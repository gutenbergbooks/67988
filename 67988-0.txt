THE VORTEX




ACT I


_The scene is the drawing-room of_ MRS. LANCASTER’S _flat in London.
The colors and decoration are on the verge of being original. The
furniture is simple but distinctly expensive._

_Persons shown are_ HELEN SAVILLE _and_ PAUNCEFORT QUENTIN. HELEN
SAVILLE _and_ PAUNCEFORT QUENTIN _are shown in by_ PRESTON. HELEN
_is a smartly dressed woman of about thirty_. “PAWNIE” _is an
elderly maiden gentleman_.

PRESTON

I’m expecting Mrs. Lancaster in at any moment now, ma’am.

HELEN

Thank you, Preston, we’ll wait a little.

PRESTON

Shall I get you some tea?

HELEN

No, thanks, we’ve already had some--give me a cigarette, Pawnie;
they’re in that box on the table.

    [PAWNIE _hands her cigarette box_. PRESTON _goes out_.]

PAWNIE

It may be tiresome of me, but I think all this coloring is
oppressive.

HELEN

You make such a “fetish” of house decoration, Pawnie.

PAWNIE

[_Wandering round the room_]

Not at all, but I do like things to be good and right.

HELEN

Well, I don’t consider the new frieze in your bathroom either good
or right.

PAWNIE

How can you, Helen! It’s too marvelous for words. Parelli designed
it specially for me.

HELEN

Personally, it would make me self-conscious to sit in a bath
surrounded by frisky gods and goddesses all with such better
figures than mine.

PAWNIE

I find it encouraging. This whole room is so typical of Florence.

HELEN

In what way?

PAWNIE

Every way. Look at the furniture.

HELEN

A little artificial perhaps, but quite harmless.

PAWNIE

Dear Helen, you’re such a loyal friend.

HELEN

I’m very fond of Florence.

PAWNIE

We all are. Oh, my God, look at that lampshade!

HELEN

I gave it to her last Christmas.

PAWNIE

Wasn’t that a little naughty of you?

HELEN

I don’t see why; it’s extremely pretty.

PAWNIE

Too unrestrained. Such a bad example for the _servants_. [_He takes
up frame from desk._] Who’s this boy?

HELEN

Tom Veryan. You must have seen him.

PAWNIE

Florence’s past, present, or future?

HELEN

Present.

PAWNIE

He has that innocent look that never fails to attract elderly women.

HELEN

Don’t be a cat.

PAWNIE

I wasn’t meaning Florence; she’s too divine to be in any marked
category.

HELEN

I wonder.

PAWNIE

Oh, yes, Helen, deathless sort of magnetism, you know.

HELEN

I often wonder what will happen to Florence eventually.

PAWNIE

My dear, I’m far too occupied in wondering what’s going to happen to
me to worry about other people.

HELEN

I’ve always thought your course was quite clear, Pawnie.

PAWNIE

However offensive that remark was intended to be, Helen, I shall
take it in the most complimentary spirit.

HELEN

I’m sure you will.

PAWNIE

I expect Florence will just go on and on, then suddenly become quite
beautifully old, and go on and on still more.

HELEN

It’s too late now for her to become beautifully old, I’m afraid.
She’ll have to be young indefinitely.

PAWNIE

I don’t suppose she’ll mind that, but it’s trying for David.

HELEN

And fiendish for Nicky.

PAWNIE

Oh, no, my dear; you’re quite wrong there. I’m sure Nicky doesn’t
care a damn.

HELEN

It’s difficult to tell with Nicky.

PAWNIE

He’s divinely selfish; all amusing people are.

HELEN

Did you hear him play in Paris?

PAWNIE

Yes.

HELEN

Well?

PAWNIE

Erratic--one or two things perfect, but he’s slovenly.

HELEN

He only takes things seriously in spurts, but still he’s very young.

PAWNIE

Do you really think that’s a good excuse.

HELEN

No, I’m afraid not, especially when so much depends on it.

PAWNIE

What does depend on it?

HELEN

Everything--his life’s happiness.

PAWNIE

Don’t be so terribly intense, dear.

HELEN

It’s true.

PAWNIE

I’m quite sure Nicky will be perfectly happy as long as he goes on
attracting people; he loves being attractive.

HELEN

Naturally, he’s Florence’s son.

PAWNIE

Such an exciting thing to be.

HELEN

You don’t believe Nicky’s got anything in him at all, do you?

PAWNIE (_lightly_)

I don’t think it matters, anyway.

HELEN

I do.

PAWNIE

But you’ve got a loving nature, Helen. I always know it.

HELEN

Nicky hasn’t had a chance.

PAWNIE

Nonsense--he’s had everything he wanted ever since the day he was
born, and he’ll go on wasting his opportunities until he dies.

HELEN

Quite possibly.

PAWNIE

Well, there you are then.

HELEN

He may have had everything he wanted, but he’s had none of the
things he really needs.

PAWNIE

Are you talking socially or spiritually?

HELEN

You’re quite right, Pawnie, you wouldn’t be so beautifully
preserved if you’d wasted any of your valuable time or sincerity.

PAWNIE

I forgive you for that, Helen, freely.

HELEN

Thank you so much.

PAWNIE

You must realize one thing, everyone is sacrificed to Florence--it’s
as it should be--of course, she’s a couple of hundred years too
late--she ought to have been a flaunting, intriguing King’s mistress,
with black page boys and jade baths and things too divine----

    [_Enter_ PRESTON.]

PRESTON

[_Announcing_]

Miss Hibbert.

    [_Enter_ CLARA HIBBERT--_she is affected, but quite well-dressed_.
    PRESTON _goes out_.]

CLARA

My _dears_. Isn’t Florence back _yet_?

HELEN

No, we’re waiting for her.

PAWNIE

You look harassed, Clara.

CLARA

I am harassed.

HELEN

Why?

CLARA

I’m singing to-night for Laura Tennant--she’s giving a dreadful
reception at her dreadful house for some dreadful Ambassador----

PAWNIE

How dreadful!

CLARA

No one will listen to me, of course--they’ll all be far too busy
avoiding the Cup and searching for the Champagne.

HELEN

What are you singing?

CLARA

One Gabriel Faure, two Reynaldo Hahn’s and an Aria.

PAWNIE

Which Aria?

CLARA

I can’t think, but my accompanist will know--I’ve got a frightful
headache.

HELEN

Why don’t you take off your hat?

CLARA

My dear, I daren’t--I’ve just had my hair done--I suppose you
haven’t got a “Cachet Faivre,” either of you?

HELEN

No, but Florence has, I expect--Preston will know where they
are--ring the bell, Pawnie.

PAWNIE

[_Ringing bell_]

My poor Clara--I do hope your singing to-night will justify the fuss
you’re making this afternoon.

CLARA

Don’t be so _brutal_, Pawnie.

HELEN

Is Gregory going with you?

CLARA

Of _course_--I _never_ sing unless he’s there--he gives me such
marvelous moral support.

PAWNIE

“Moral” is hardly the word _I_ should have chosen, dear.

    [_Enter_ PRESTON.]

HELEN

Do you know if Mrs. Lancaster has any “Cachet Faivre” anywhere?

PRESTON

Yes, ma’am--I think so.

CLARA

_Do_ get me one, Preston, I’m suffering _tortures_.

PRESTON

Very well, miss.

    [_She goes out._]

PAWNIE

Preston has such wonderful poise, hasn’t she?

HELEN

She needs it in this house.

CLARA

I do wish Florence would hurry up. I want to borrow her green fan.
I’ve got a new Patou frock that positively _demands_ it.

HELEN

She can’t be long now.

CLARA

I suppose I daren’t ask Preston for the fan and creep away with it?

HELEN

I shouldn’t, if I were you--Florence is very touchy over that sort
of thing.

CLARA

She promised it to me ages ago.

PAWNIE

Surely there isn’t such a desperate hurry? You won’t be singing
until about half-past eleven.

CLARA

[_Petulantly_]

My _dear_, I’ve got to _rehearse_--I don’t know a _word_----

    [_Re-enter_ PRESTON _with a “Cachet Faivre” and a glass of
    water_.]

CLARA

You’re a _saint_, Preston--thank you a _thousand_ times----

PAWNIE

Soak it a little first, dear, or you’ll choke, and I should _detest_
that.

    [CLARA _soaks “Cachet” and then swallows it_. PRESTON _goes
    out_.]

CLARA

Now I must lie down _flat_--get out of the way, Helen.

PAWNIE

Perhaps you’d like us _both_ to go _right_ out of the room and sit
in the _hall_?

CLARA

No, Pawnie, I should never expect the least consideration from you.

    [_She lies down flat on the divan_, HELEN _arranges cushions
    for her_.]

CLARA

Thank you, Helen darling--I shall always come to you whenever I’m
ill.

HELEN

That _will_ be nice.

    [_Enter_ FLORENCE LANCASTER _followed by_ TOM VERYAN. FLORENCE
    _is brilliantly dressed almost to the point of being “outré.”
    Her face still retains the remnants of great beauty._ TOM _is
    athletic and good-looking. One feels he is good at games and
    extremely bad at everything else._]

FLORENCE

Helen--Pawnie, have you been here long?

PAWNIE

No, only a few hours.

FLORENCE

My dear. I’m so frightfully sorry--we’ve been held up for ages in
the traffic. Davis is a congenital idiot. Always manages to get to
a turning just as the policeman puts out his hand. No initiative
whatever. What’s happened to Clara? Has she been run over?

CLARA

No, dear, I’ve got a frightful head.

FLORENCE

Pawnie, you know Tom, don’t you?--Tom Veryan, Mr. Quentin, I’m sure
you’ll adore each other.

TOM

[_Shaking hands_]

How are you?

PAWNIE

Very well, thank you--how sweet of you to ask me?

FLORENCE

Is there anything I can do, Clara?

CLARA

Yes, dear, lend me your green fan for to-night.

FLORENCE

All right--but you _won’t_ get too carried away with it, will you,
dear? I should hate the feathers to come out. Does anyone want any
tea?

HELEN

No thanks, dear.

FLORENCE

Cocktails, then?

PAWNIE

It’s too early.

FLORENCE

[_Ringing bell_]

It’s never too early for a cocktail.

CLARA

I should like to go quite quietly into a convent and never see
anybody again ever----

PAWNIE

Gregory would be bored stiff in a convent.

FLORENCE

We’ve just been to a most frightful Charity _matinée_. Nothing
but inaudible speeches from dreary old actors, and leading ladies
nudging one another all over the stage. [PRESTON _enters_.]
Cocktails, Preston, and ask Barker to wrap up my green fan for Miss
Hibbert to take away with her.

PRESTON

Very good, ma’am.

    [_She goes out._]

CLARA

You’re an angel, Florence--I think I’ll sit up now.

FLORENCE

Do, dear, then Tom will be able to sit down.

CLARA

[_Sitting up_]

I really do feel most peculiar.

PAWNIE

You look far from normal, dear.

CLARA

If Pawnie’s rude to me any more I shall burst into tears.

FLORENCE

Tom, give me a cigarette.

PAWNIE

Here are some.

FLORENCE

No, Tom has a special rather hearty kind that I adore.

CLARA

Lend me your lip stick, Helen; mine has sunk down into itself.

HELEN

Here you are.

CLARA

What a lovely color! I look far prettier than I feel.

FLORENCE

    [_To_ TOM]

Thank you, angel.

CLARA

I shan’t be able to get down to the house until Saturday evening,
Florence--I’m seeing Gregory off to Newcastle.

PAWNIE

Why Newcastle?

CLARA

His home’s just near there--isn’t it too awful for him?

FLORENCE

Well, wire me the time of your train, won’t you?

CLARA

Of course, dear.

HELEN

You’re smelling divinely, Florence. What is it?

FLORENCE

[_Flicking her handkerchief_]

It is good, isn’t it?

PAWNIE

“Narcisse Noir” of Caron. I use it.

FLORENCE

Yes, you would, Pawnie.

    [_Re-enter_ PRESTON _with parcel_.]

PRESTON

Here is the fan, miss.

CLARA

[_Taking it_]

Thank you _so_ much--you are sweet, Florence. A fan gives me such a
feeling of _security_ when I’m singing modern stuff. [PRESTON _goes
out_.] I must rush now----

FLORENCE

Don’t you want a cocktail before you go?

CLARA

No, darling--I should only hiccup all the evening. Good-bye, you’ve
been _such_ a comfort--good-bye, Helen--Pawnie, you will be nicer to
me over the week-end, won’t you? I shall be _so_ depressed, what
with Gregory going away and everything--Good-bye, Tom--I shall dine
in bed and give way at every pore----

    [_She goes out._]

PAWNIE

Poor Clara--she eternally labors under the delusion that she really
matters.

HELEN

We all do that a little.

FLORENCE

[_Laughing_]

You’re awfully cruel to her, Pawnie.

PAWNIE

She upsets my vibrations.

FLORENCE

    [_Before glass_]

I’ve taken a sudden hatred to this hat. [_She takes it off._] That’s
better--are you going to the “New Elaine” to-night, either of you?

HELEN

I’m not--but Pawnie is, of course.

PAWNIE

It’s going to be _amazing_--what a cast, my dear! Marvelous Selwyn
Steele, Nora Dean, and that perfect woman, Lily Burfield----

HELEN

I can’t stand her, she always over-acts.

PAWNIE

    [_Incensed_]

How _can_ you, Helen! Did you see her in “Simple Faith”?

HELEN

Yes, unfortunately.

PAWNIE

Oh, you’re really too tiresome for words!

HELEN

Her technique creaks like machinery.

PAWNIE

It’s sacrilege--she’s too, too marvelous.

    [_Enter_ PRESTON _with a tray of cocktails. All help
    themselves._]

FLORENCE

What do you think about it, Tom?

TOM

I’ve never seen her.

FLORENCE

Yes, you have. About three months ago, at the Comedy.

TOM

Oh.... I don’t remember.

PAWNIE

Don’t remember! An artist like that! Good God, it’s agony!

HELEN

You’ll look awfully tired at dinner-time, Pawnie, if you don’t calm
down a little.

FLORENCE

This is special--my own invention.

HELEN

Absolutely delicious.

TOM

A bit too sweet.

FLORENCE

Tom, _darling_, don’t be so taciturn--he’s always taciturn after a
_matinée_.

PAWNIE

When’s Nicky coming back?

FLORENCE

To-morrow. Isn’t it too divine? He’s been away for a whole year, but
I saw him for a moment on my way through Paris last month.

PAWNIE

Has he been working hard?

FLORENCE

I suppose so, but you know what Nicky is--bless his heart!

PAWNIE

I heard him play at Yvonne Mirabeau’s.

FLORENCE

She’s a loathsome woman, isn’t she?

HELEN

Not as bad as that.

PAWNIE

She’s a half-wit. I can’t bear half-wits.

FLORENCE

She goes on so dreadfully about things--devastating.

PAWNIE

Funny Nicky liking her so much.

FLORENCE

Only because she keeps on saying how wonderful he is--that always
appeals to Nicky.

PAWNIE

How old is he now?

FLORENCE

Twenty-four. Isn’t it absurd to think I have such a grown-up
son--old General Fenwick said last Thursday that---- [_The
telephone rings; she goes to it._] Hallo--hallo! Yes, my dear.
How are you?... Yes, so am I, simply worn out.... No. When? How
perfectly marvelous!... No, dear, it’s a prescription; but I can
let you have a little in a jar.... Quite easy. All you do is just
rub it on at night.... Don’t be so silly.... Not in the least; if
you send the car round that will be all right.... Very well....
Good-bye, darling. [_She hangs up receiver._] I give Clara Hibbert
ten for stupidity. Don’t you, Helen?

HELEN

A hundred and ten.

PAWNIE

Ten’s the limit.

TOM

I say, Florence--I think I’d better be getting along if I’ve got to
be dressed and back here by half-past seven----

FLORENCE

You’ve got half an hour.

TOM

That’s not very much.

FLORENCE

The car’s outside ... take it and send it straight back.

PAWNIE

Can it drop me, Florence dear? I always feel so much richer in your
car than anyone else’s.

FLORENCE

Of course, Pawnie.

[_The telephone rings again._]

FLORENCE

[_At telephone_]

Hallo!... Yes ... speaking.... How do you do----?

PAWNIE

Good-bye, Helen. It’s been divine----

HELEN

Ring me up at tea-time to-morrow.

FLORENCE

How perfectly sweet of you!... Now, now, really.... Well, naturally,
if you persist in saying such charming things ... [_laughing gayly_]
... What nonsense!...

PAWNIE

Good-bye, Florence----

FLORENCE

[_She puts her hand over mouthpiece_]

It’s that awful General Fenwick.... Good-bye, Pawnie dear. You’re
coming down to the house on Friday?

PAWNIE

Yes; too lovely----

FLORENCE

Helen’s coming by the five-o’clock--you’d better travel together.

PAWNIE

Perfect. [_To_ TOM.] Are you ready?

TOM

Quite.

PAWNIE

[_As they go out_]

You _can_ drop me first, can’t you? I’m not as young as I was----

FLORENCE

[_At telephone_]

Please forgive me. People rushing in and out, this house grows
more like a railway station every day.... Now, General, that was
a deliberate compliment. [_She laughs._] Ridiculous man.... Very
well.... Good-bye. [_She hangs up receiver._] My God! ten for
dreariness!

HELEN

He’s not a bad old thing.

FLORENCE

No, but he tries to be, and that’s what’s so frightful. [_Arranging
her hair before glass._] I look like Death.... Isn’t Tom a darling?

HELEN

Yes, dear, without being aggressively brilliant.

FLORENCE

I’m afraid, Helen, you’re getting rather bitter.

HELEN

Nonsense.

FLORENCE

It’s silly to be sarcastic about Tom.

HELEN

It’s better than being maudlin about him.

FLORENCE

I don’t know what you mean, dear. I’m not in the least maudlin, and
never have been about anybody. I sometimes wish I could be--I’m too
hard.

HELEN

[_Taking a cigarette_]

Tom will let you down.

FLORENCE

Let me down? Why ... how ... I don’t understand----

HELEN

You’re more in love with him than he is with you.

FLORENCE

Don’t be so _absurd_, Helen.

HELEN

It’s true.

FLORENCE

    [_Complacently_]

He adores me--worships me--he’s never seen anyone like me before in
his life. I’m something strange ... exotic----

HELEN

You’re more in love with him than he is with you.

FLORENCE

You’re getting on my nerves to-day, Helen.

HELEN

You do see that I’m right, don’t you?

FLORENCE

If you knew some of the things he’s said to me.

HELEN

I can guess them.

FLORENCE

That boy was utterly unawakened until he met me.

HELEN

He’s very young.

FLORENCE

I’ve taught him--everything.

HELEN

Or nothing.

FLORENCE

Helen, I believe you’re jealous.

HELEN

Don’t be a fool.

FLORENCE

I wish I hadn’t this fatal knack of seeing through people.

HELEN

How’s David?

FLORENCE

I don’t know. He ought to be home soon.

HELEN

Doesn’t he ever suspect anything?

FLORENCE

Of course not--he adores me.

HELEN

It seems so strange not to see----

FLORENCE

I’m devoted to David--I’d do anything for him, anything in the
world--but he’s grown old and I’ve kept young; it does muddle
things up so. I can’t help having a temperament, can I?

HELEN

Temperament.... No.

FLORENCE

David’s always loved me and never understood me--you see, I’m such
an extraordinary _mixture_. I have so many _sides_ to my character.
I adore being at home and running the house and looking after David
and Nicky----

HELEN

You don’t exactly overdo it.

FLORENCE

Well, Nicky’s been away for such ages. Also, one must be in London
for the season. You can’t expect me to bury myself in the country
indefinitely. I shall be there practically all through the spring
and summer.

HELEN

Lovely tennis parties and cricket weeks and things----

FLORENCE

Certainly.

HELEN

[_Kissing her_]

You’re a divine creature, Florence.

FLORENCE

[_Basking_]

Am I? [_The telephone rings._] Hallo!... Yes--speaking. [_To_ HELEN
_in a whisper_.] It’s Inez Zulieta. I never went to her recital....
Inez _darling_, I never recognized your voice.... Didn’t you get
my note?... It was absolutely true, I was in agony.... Inez, don’t
be angry. If you only knew how I longed for the sound of your
wonderful, wonderful voice.... Darling.... Inez, don’t be so
cruel.... To-morrow, then. [_She hangs up receiver._] I do wish
Inez wasn’t so persistent.

HELEN

You never stop encouraging her.

FLORENCE

Oh, Helen, I’m so tired of everyone.

HELEN

Except Tom?

FLORENCE

Yes, except Tom; he’s such a darling.

HELEN

How do you think he and Nicky will get on?

FLORENCE

Marvelously--Tom loves music.

HELEN

He says he does.

FLORENCE

My dear, I took him to that Russian thing the other day and he sat
entranced from beginning to end.

HELEN

Poor Nicky!

FLORENCE

Why do you say that?

HELEN

Because I sometimes feel it.

FLORENCE

[_Suddenly furious_]

Oh, I wonder why we’re such friends--we’re so opposite--you don’t
understand me a bit. I used to think you did, but you’ve been
different lately--unsympathetic.

HELEN

No, I haven’t.

FLORENCE

Yes, you have--over Tom--I believe you’re in love with him yourself.

HELEN

[_Smiling_]

No--it isn’t that.

FLORENCE

Anyhow, you can’t bear him being in love with me.

HELEN

I don’t think he is--really. I quite realize that he _was_ very
violently infatuated, but that is wearing off a bit now. I’m
beginning to see him as he is....

FLORENCE

No, no, it’s not true--you don’t understand----

HELEN

We _are_ friends, Florence, though we’re so “opposite.” Do you
really know the truth--inside you? Or is all this shrill vanity
real?

FLORENCE

What’s the matter with you?

HELEN

You’re ten years older than I am, but when I’m your age I shall be
twenty years older than you.

FLORENCE

_Darling_, how deliciously involved--what _can_ you mean by that?

HELEN

I mean, I think it’s silly not to grow old when the time comes.

    [_She rises and goes towards door._]

FLORENCE

[_Outraged_]

Helen! [_There is suddenly heard a violent knocking at the front
door._] What on earth is that?

    [_There is a noise outside, then the door bursts open and_
    NICKY _enters. He is extremely well-dressed in traveling
    clothes. He is tall and pale, with thin, nervous hands._]

FLORENCE

Nicky!

NICKY

Mother!

    [_He embraces her._]

FLORENCE

But I’d no idea--I thought you were coming to-morrow.

NICKY

No, to-day--I wrote to you.

FLORENCE

I’m terribly, terribly excited.

NICKY

Helen, dear, how are you?

    [_He kisses her._]

HELEN

Splendid, Nicky.

FLORENCE

I can’t get over you arriving like this.... I never realized----

NICKY

Silly ... you’re looking awfully well.

FLORENCE

Am I?

NICKY

Wonderful, as usual.

FLORENCE

I was talking to George Morrison only last Thursday----

NICKY

The man who wrote that fearful book?

FLORENCE

It isn’t a fearful book, it’s brilliant--anyhow, he absolutely
refused to believe that I had a grown-up son.

HELEN

My dears, I must fly.

NICKY

Don’t go yet.

HELEN

I must--I’m hours late as it is.

NICKY

Be a little later, then.

FLORENCE

Remember, five-o’clock train on Friday.

NICKY

Oh, is she coming down to the house? Divine!

HELEN

Yes, if Florence is still speaking to me. Good-bye.

    [_She goes out._]

NICKY

Have you been having a scene?

FLORENCE

No, dear.

NICKY

She’s a darling--Helen----

FLORENCE

Extremely stupid and tactless sometimes.

NICKY

It doesn’t feel as though I’d been away at all.

FLORENCE

I’ve missed you appallingly--we had such a short time together in
Paris. Did you enjoy all my letters?

NICKY

I adored them--so did John Bagot. I used to read most of them aloud
to him. He’s mad on you--saw your pictures in the _Tatler_, or
something, and fell in love with it.

FLORENCE

Is he nice?

NICKY

He’s grand.

FLORENCE

We must all dine at the Embassy. When is he coming to England?

NICKY

Not until after Christmas.

FLORENCE

You must see my new photographs; they’re wonderful.

    [_She takes large packet from desk._]

NICKY

It’s heavenly--being back.

FLORENCE

Look.

NICKY

I don’t like that one.

FLORENCE

How can you, Nicky! Tom likes that one best of all.

NICKY

Who’s Tom?

FLORENCE

Tom Veryan--he’s a dear; you’ll like him frightfully--you know--the
very nicest type of Englishman.

NICKY

I hate the very nicest type of Englishman.

FLORENCE

Don’t be tiresome, Nicky; he’s only twenty-four, and they all think
_so_ well of him----

NICKY

All who?

FLORENCE

All his officers and people; he’s in the Brigade.

NICKY

[_Holding photograph away from him and scrutinizing it through
half-closed eyes_]

Now that one really is _enchanting_--they’ve got your hair
_beautifully_. Oh, yes, my dear, it’s perfect----

FLORENCE

[_Complacently_]

It _is_ good. She’s sweet--Madame Henderson, she simply won’t hear
of my paying for these--she says it’s quite sufficient to be allowed
to exhibit them in the window.

NICKY

Is anyone dining this evening?

FLORENCE

No. Oh, dear! I’d forgotten--I’m dining out with Tom.

NICKY

Oh--I see.

FLORENCE

Your first night home, too--how perfectly fiendish. What a fool I am
to have muddled it up.

NICKY

It doesn’t matter, darling.

FLORENCE

Oh, but it _does_. I wonder if we could get another seat----

NICKY

Seat? What for?

FLORENCE

We’re going to the first night of “The New Elaine.” It’s going to be
marvelous.

NICKY

Who’s in it?

FLORENCE

Nora Dean and Selwyn Steele----

NICKY

Oh, God!

FLORENCE

It’s silly of you _always_ to jeer at Selwyn Steele. He’ s a
brilliant actor, if only he could get away from his wife....

NICKY

I couldn’t bear him to-night, anyway; I’m tired. Is father home yet?

FLORENCE

No, I don’t think so. Oh, I do feel such a beast----

NICKY

Don’t be silly--honestly, I don’t mind a bit.

FLORENCE

I know--you have a nice quiet dinner here and join us at the Embassy
afterwards.

NICKY

Is it a late night?

FLORENCE

Yes, they play the most heavenly tune there now--Tom always makes
them do it over and over again--I’ll put it on----

    [_She goes to the gramophone._]

NICKY

How’s Iris?

FLORENCE

My dear, don’t speak of her.

NICKY

Why--what’s she done?

FLORENCE

She’s been absolutely foul.

NICKY

In what way?

FLORENCE

Every way--I never trusted her, luckily--Thank God I’ve got
instincts about people--listen, isn’t this marvelous--She said the
most filthy things to Gloria Craig about me--I always knew she was
insanely jealous, but there are limits. I loathe being at people’s
beck and call.... Come and dance.

NICKY

[_As they dance_]

I’m sorry you’ve rowed--I rather liked her----

FLORENCE

Only because she kept on saying how wonderful you were.... She
doesn’t know a thing about music really.

NICKY

Oh yes, she does.

FLORENCE

It’s merely bluff--all that appreciation. _Darling_, how oddly
you’re dancing.

NICKY

It’s probably because we haven’t danced together for so long....

FLORENCE

Anyhow, now she’s gone off to Monte Carlo with Violet Fenchurch--silly
fool----

    [_Enter_ DAVID LANCASTER. _He is an elderly gray-haired
    pleasant man._]

DAVID

[_Delighted_]

Nicky--my boy----

NICKY

[_Kissing him_]

Hallo, father----

DAVID

I thought--Florence said--to-morrow----

NICKY

Mother muddled it up.

DAVID

You look rather tired.

NICKY

I’m splendid. How’s everything?

DAVID

The same as usual. I’ve made lots of improvements down at the house.

FLORENCE

David thinks and talks of nothing but the farm----

DAVID

It’s beginning to pay a bit--Peterson’s an awfully good man.

NICKY

We’ll make a grand tour of it on Sunday.

DAVID

Have you enjoyed yourself in Paris?

NICKY

Oh yes, rather--it’s a splendid place to work.

DAVID

It never struck me that way quite, but still----

FLORENCE

Sophie de Molignac said Nicky’s playing had improved wonderfully.

DAVID

I’m so glad, Nicky.

NICKY

I’ve been doing some Spanish stuff lately.

DAVID

I wish I knew more about it.

NICKY

Never mind, father.

DAVID

Come to my room and talk. I can’t bear that thing----

FLORENCE

Father’s such a beast; he never will dance with me.

DAVID

Is the _Evening News_ anywhere about?

NICKY

Yes, here.

    [_He gives it to him_.]

DAVID

I’m so glad you’re home again, Nicky--don’t forget--come and
talk....

    [_He goes out_.]

FLORENCE

David’s so much happier in the country.

NICKY

Why on earth doesn’t he retire and live at the house for good?

FLORENCE

Work has become such a habit with him--he’s always hated giving up
habits.

NICKY

Mother--I’ve got something rather important to tell you.

FLORENCE

Darling, how thrilling! What is it?

NICKY

I am engaged to be married.

FLORENCE

What!

NICKY

Practically--as much as one can be these days.

FLORENCE

Nicky!

NICKY

Don’t look so stricken.

FLORENCE

But, Nicky--I never sort of visualized you being engaged, or
married, or anything.

NICKY

Why not?

FLORENCE

You’re not old enough.

NICKY

I’m twenty-four.

FLORENCE

You don’t look it.... Thank God!

NICKY

What do you really feel about it, mother?

FLORENCE

_Darling_--I hardly know what to say--you’ve sprung it on me so
suddenly. Who is she?

NICKY

A girl called Bunty Mainwaring.

FLORENCE

What a silly name!

NICKY

It isn’t at all--it’s very attractive.

FLORENCE

Is she an actress, or a student, or what?

NICKY

Neither--she is what is technically termed a “lady.”

FLORENCE

Do you think she’ll like me?

NICKY

She went mad over your photograph.

FLORENCE

Which one?

NICKY

The “looking out of the window” one.

FLORENCE

That really is one of the best I’ve ever had done.

NICKY

She said you had the face of an heroic little boy.

FLORENCE

What a _divine_ thing to say!

    [_She glances at herself in the glass._]

NICKY

She does say divine things--she’s supremely intelligent.

FLORENCE

Is she in Paris?

NICKY

No, she came over with me to-day.

FLORENCE

Where does she live?

NICKY

Just round the corner in Carbury Square.

FLORENCE

Near the Churchingtons.

NICKY

It’s her mother’s house, but her mother’s away just now, so I asked
her to change quickly and come on here.

FLORENCE

Nicky!

NICKY

Why not? I wanted you to see her as soon as possible.

FLORENCE

[_Realizing parental responsibility_]

It’s an awful shock, you know.

NICKY

Nonsense, mother--you’re quite excited about it, really.

FLORENCE

[_With determination_]

I shall be charming to her.

NICKY

Then she’ll adore you at once--probably too much, and I shall be
jealous.

FLORENCE

You’d better both dine here together and come on to the Embassy. How
old is she?

NICKY

Twenty-three.

FLORENCE

What does she do?

NICKY

Nothing much--she writes things occasionally.

FLORENCE

Where did you meet her?

NICKY

First of all at a party at Olive Lloyd-Kennedy’s.

FLORENCE

I can’t bear Olive Lloyd-Kennedy--she’s a cat.

NICKY

Then I met her again at Marion Fawcett’s--a frightful sort of
reception affair--she was staying with her.

FLORENCE

She seems to move exclusively with my worst enemies. Is she pretty?

NICKY

I don’t know--I haven’t really noticed.

FLORENCE

[_With a touch of real feeling_]

Nicky darling, I do feel so extraordinary about it.

NICKY

Why extraordinary?

FLORENCE

It’s a milestone, isn’t it--you being engaged? A definite milestone?
[_She catches sight of herself._] Look at my nose. [_She powders
it._] I do hope she’ll like me--I must go and dress now; Tom is
fetching me half-past seven. Bring her to my room when she comes.

NICKY

Don’t go for a minute.

FLORENCE

I must, really--Tom will be furious.

NICKY

Oh, damn Tom!

FLORENCE

Oh, Nicky, _don’t_ go and take one of your tiresome prejudices
against him.

NICKY

[_Smiling_]

All right, I’ll try not to.

FLORENCE

He’s frightfully good-looking.

NICKY

Oh!

FLORENCE

And he adores music.

NICKY

Now, then, mother----

FLORENCE

He does, honestly.

NICKY

Good.

FLORENCE

And he dances beautifully.

NICKY

I shall never stop dancing with him.

FLORENCE

And he’s so good at games.

NICKY

He sounds adorable.

FLORENCE

Of course, he needs knowing.

NICKY

So do I.

FLORENCE

You will make an effort, though, darling, won’t you? For my sake!

NICKY

Yes, mother.

FLORENCE

And we’ll all have a divine time together, Tom and me and you and
what’s her name----

NICKY

Bunty.

FLORENCE

Oh yes, of course, Bunty.

    [_Front door bell rings._]

NICKY

This is her, I expect.

FLORENCE

Do you feel wonderful about her?

NICKY

Yes.

FLORENCE

It is thrilling, isn’t it--being in love?

NICKY

[_Frowning a little_]

Yes.

FLORENCE

Your father was right--you look awfully tired, Nicky.

NICKY

What nonsense! I feel grand.

    [_Enter_ PRESTON.]

PRESTON

[_Announcing_]

Miss Mainwaring.

    [BUNTY _comes in, very self-assured and well-dressed. She is
    more attractive than pretty in a boyish sort of way._]

    [PRESTON _goes out_.]

NICKY

Bunty. You have been quick.

BUNTY

I’ve simply flown.

NICKY

Bunty ... here is mother....

BUNTY

Oh!

FLORENCE

[_Taking both her hands_]

This is frightfully exciting, isn’t it?

    [_She kisses her._]

NICKY

I’ve told her.

BUNTY

Are you furious?

FLORENCE

Of course not. Why should I be? ’Specially now.

BUNTY

It’s absolutely incredible, you being Nicky’s mother.

FLORENCE

Am I anything like you thought I’d be?

BUNTY

Yes, exactly--but I couldn’t believe it until I saw you.

FLORENCE

Take off that perfectly divine cloak and have a cigarette. I’ve
got to rush and dress now, because I’m _terribly_ late, but you’re
dining here with Nicky and joining Tom Veryan and me at the Embassy
afterwards.

BUNTY

Tom Veryan?...

FLORENCE

Yes. Do you know him?

BUNTY

I did when I was a child--if it’s the same one.

    [_She takes off her cloak._]

FLORENCE

[_Effusively_]

Nicky--I don’t feel extraordinary about it any more--I’m _delighted_.

NICKY

Angel.

FLORENCE

Perhaps Bunty would like to come down to the house on Friday for the
week-end?

NICKY

Oh yes! Marvelous.

BUNTY

It’s awfully sweet of you, Mrs. Lancaster.

FLORENCE

You must call me Florence; I can’t bear Mrs. Lancaster. I must fly;
Tom will be here at any moment--that’s him on the desk.

BUNTY

[_Going over to photograph_]

Yes--it is the same one.

FLORENCE

How too divine!...

    [_Telephone rings._]

Hallo!... Yes, speaking!... Elsa darling, how are you?... What?...
To-night?... How perfectly heavenly! Of course, I’d adore it....
Listen. Nicky’s just back from Paris. Can he come, too, with Bunty
Mainwaring?... Yes, he’s here.... See you to-night, dear....

Here, Nicky, talk to Elsa....

    [_She snatches up her hand-bag and fur coat and kisses_ BUNTY
    _effusively_.]

I’m so glad about you and Nicky--It’s too wonderful.

    [_She rushes out._]

NICKY

[_At telephone_]

Hallo, Elsa.... I’d no idea you were in London. I’m terribly
thrilled. My dear, you haven’t.... All those lovely tunes you
played to me in Paris?... _How amazing!_ I _am_ glad.... Have you
done anything with that Tango?... You must play it to-night; I want
Bunty to hear it.... It is perfect, isn’t it?... Good-bye, dear.
[_He hangs up the receiver._] Bunty.

BUNTY

What?

NICKY

I’m terribly happy.

BUNTY

So am I.

NICKY

Do you remember how we planned all this--coming home together--and
breaking it to mother--and everything?

BUNTY

Rather.

NICKY

Do you really like her?

BUNTY

I adore her--she’s a perfect angel.

NICKY

I told her your “heroic little boy” line; she loved it.

BUNTY

It’s true, you know--rather defiant too--laughing at Fate.

NICKY

Doesn’t Paris seem ages away now?

BUNTY

A different life altogether.

NICKY

That nasty little bit of Channel is such an enormous gulf, really.
Did you put that dress on on purpose.

BUNTY

[_Smiling_]

Perhaps.

NICKY

You are a devil.

BUNTY

It’s such fun being reminded of things.

NICKY

And such agony, too.

BUNTY

Nicky darling--why agony?

NICKY

It’s always agony being in love, and I started loving you in that
dress.

BUNTY

Did you?

NICKY

Don’t pretend you didn’t know.

BUNTY

I suppose one always knows--really.

NICKY

From the very first moment.

BUNTY

Yes.

NICKY

A sort of spark.

BUNTY

Your playing helped a lot.

NICKY

I meant it to.

BUNTY

Calculating pig.

NICKY

Have a cigarette?

BUNTY

All right.

    [_He hands her box, and she takes one._]

NICKY

[_Lighting her cigarette_]

I wish we weren’t so free.

BUNTY

Why? What do you mean?

NICKY

I feel I should like to elope, or something violently romantic like
that.

BUNTY

[_Laughing_]

There wouldn’t be much point in it now, would there?

NICKY

Perhaps not. How much do you love me?

BUNTY

I don’t know.

NICKY

It’s fun analyzing one’s emotions.

BUNTY

Marvelous fun.

NICKY

And a comfort, too, when things go wrong--but it kills sentiment
stone dead.

BUNTY

A good job, too.

NICKY

You’re frightfully hard, Bunty.

BUNTY

Am I?

NICKY

Much harder than me--really.

BUNTY

You’ve got so much hysteria.

NICKY

I can’t help it.

BUNTY

Of course not; it’s your temperament. You burst out suddenly.

NICKY

Not so badly as I used to.

BUNTY

You’re growing older.

NICKY

God, yes! Isn’t it foul?

BUNTY

Hell, my dear.

NICKY

It’s funny how mother’s generation always longed to be old when they
were young, and we strain every nerve to keep young.

BUNTY

That’s because we see what’s coming so much more clearly.

NICKY

Wouldn’t it be terrible to know _exactly_?--I feel frightened
sometimes.

BUNTY

Why?

NICKY

We’re all so hectic and nervy....

BUNTY

It doesn’t matter--it probably only means we shan’t live so long....

NICKY

[_Suddenly_]

Shut up--shut up....

    [_Enter_ PRESTON.]

PRESTON

[_Announcing_]

Mr. Veryan.

    [_Enter_ TOM. NICKY _greets him and shakes hands. Exit_
    PRESTON.]

NICKY

How are you? I’m Nicky--I came over to-day instead of to-morrow....

TOM

Oh!

NICKY

Do you know Bunty Mainwaring?

TOM

Bunty--I say--I am glad.

    [_They shake hands warmly._]

NICKY

We’d better have some cocktails.

    [_He goes to the door and shouts._]

Preston ... bring us some cocktails....

TOM

This _is_ jolly. I didn’t know what had become of you.

BUNTY

I’ve been living in Paris a good deal.

TOM

How many years ago is it since we?...

BUNTY

During the War. The last time I saw you you were at Sandhurst.

NICKY

Such a pretty place.

TOM

You’ve hardly altered a bit--more grown up, of course.

NICKY

All this is most affecting.

TOM

Bunty and I used to know each other awfully well.

NICKY

What fun!

BUNTY

[_Warningly_]

Nicky....

NICKY

But it is--it’s thrilling--there’s nothing so charming as a reunion.

BUNTY

Nicky and I have been traveling all day.... Boats and trains get on
his nerves....

NICKY

When the cocktails come, tell Preston to bring mine to me in
father’s room.

BUNTY

Nicky, don’t be so silly.

NICKY

Surely it’s not silly to want to talk to my aged father after a
year’s debauch in Paris? I fail to see why you should have the
monopoly of reunions.

BUNTY

Well, don’t be long.

TOM

Cheerio!

NICKY

[_Crossly_]

Oh, God!

    [_He goes out._]

TOM

What’s up?

BUNTY

These temperamental musicians.

TOM

Silly ass.

BUNTY

He isn’t really--he’s only jealous.

TOM

Why ... is he?...

BUNTY

We’re by way of being engaged.

TOM

What?

BUNTY

Why not?

TOM

Are you ... are you in love with him?

BUNTY

[_Lightly_]

Yes--isn’t it damnable?

TOM

Good Lord!

    [_He laughs._]

BUNTY

What are you laughing at?

TOM

It seems so funny you being in love with that sort of chap.

BUNTY

What do you mean by “that sort of chap”?

TOM

Oh--I don’t know, that type seems so unlike you.

BUNTY

Type?

TOM

Yes, you know--up in the air--effeminate.

BUNTY

You’re more bucolic than you used to be, Tom.

TOM

Here, I say....

    [_Enter_ PRESTON _with cocktails_.]

BUNTY

Will you please take Mr. Nicky’s in to him in his father’s room?

PRESTON

Yes, miss.

TOM

Is Mrs. Lancaster nearly ready?

PRESTON

I think so, sir.

TOM

Ask her to hurry. We shall be late.

PRESTON

Yes, sir.

    [_He goes out._]

BUNTY

I can laugh now.

    [_She does so._]

TOM

Why?

BUNTY

I’ve just realized something.

TOM

What?

BUNTY

We shall meet again--over the week-end.

TOM

Are you coming down to the house?

BUNTY

Yes.

TOM

That’s splendid. Come for a tramp Sunday morning and we’ll talk.

BUNTY

What about?

TOM

Oh, lots of things--old times.

BUNTY

[_Lifting her cocktail_]

Old times, Tom.

TOM

[_Doing the same_]

Cheerio!

CURTAIN




ACT II




ACT II


_The scene is the hall of_ MRS. LANCASTER’S _house, about forty
miles from London._

_When the curtain rises it is just after dinner on the Sunday
of the week-end party--the gramophone is going and there is a
continual buzz of conversation._ CLARA HIBBERT, _an emaciated
soprano, is dancing with_ TOM VERYAN, HELEN _with_ PAWNIE, _and_
NICKY _with_ BUNTY. FLORENCE _is seated on the club fender, talking
intellectually with_ BRUCE FAIRLIGHT, _an earnest dramatist, the
squalor of whose plays is much appreciated by those who live in
comparative luxury_.

_There must be a feeling of hectic amusement and noise, and the
air black with cigarette smoke and superlatives. During the first
part of the scene everyone must appear to be talking at once, but
the actual lines spoken while dancing must be timed to reach the
audience as the speakers pass near the footlights. This scene will
probably be exceedingly difficult to produce, but is absolutely
indispensable._

HELEN

It’s much too fast, Nicky.

TOM

Do slow down a bit.

NICKY

It’s the pace that’s marked on the record.

PAWNIE

I’ve never danced well since the War, I don’t know why.

FLORENCE

But your last act was so strong, when she came in half mad with
fright and described everything minutely.

BRUCE

I try to write as _honestly_ as possible.

CLARA

I gave her three for manners, but seven for charm, because I had to
be a _little_ nice!

TOM

I thought she was rather a decent sort.

BUNTY

No, but really, Nicky, his technique completely annihilated his
inspiration.

NICKY

Not with Debussy and Ravel, with the older masters, yes; but he’s
probably tired of them.

BUNTY

That’s so stupid, I think.

HELEN

My dear, it was the most “chic” thing you’ve ever seen, but
unfortunately the wrong color.

PAWNIE

Marion Ferris had that Poiret model copied in the most frightful
blue!

CLARA

I believe my shoe’s coming off.

TOM

Shall we stop?

CLARA

No, it’s all right.

FLORENCE

I wonder if you could gouge this cigarette-end out of the holder
for me?

BRUCE

I’ll try. [_He does so._] I always smoke a pipe when I’m working.

FLORENCE

How soothing!

BUNTY

I suppose one can never really judge properly from a recital.

NICKY

Not with him, because he’s not dramatic enough.

BUNTY

Dramatic pianists make me uncomfortable.

HELEN

Pawnie, your tongue grows more venomous every day.

PAWNIE

[_Giggling_]

Well, I had to say something--anyhow, it was true.

HELEN

Especially about her ankles.

PAWNIE

My dear, yes!

    [_They both laugh._]

    [_The record comes to an end, and_ NICKY _begins to change it.
    Everyone talks and laughs._]

CLARA

You must come next Sunday week.

TOM

Thanks awfully, I’d love to.

CLARA

I’m only singing ballads, but you know what Sunday concerts are.

TOM

Oh yes, rather.

CLARA

[_To_ NICKY]

What’s on the other side?

NICKY

“You’ve got the cutest ears and eyes and nose.”

PAWNIE

Do put on “Spoony Moon in Upper Carolina.”

HELEN

No, don’t put it on, Nicky; play it yourself; you always make the
gramophone go too quickly.

BUNTY

Yes, go on, Nicky.

FLORENCE

[_Refusing_ BRUCE’S _offer of a cigarette_]

No, thanks, not another--I’m dancing with Tom.

BUNTY

[_Gayly_]

Missing one, Tom.

TOM

Righto!

    [NICKY _commences to play a fox-trot_.]

BUNTY

[_Dragging_ BRUCE _to his feet_]

Come on, Mr. Fairlight, don’t overdo the serious dramatist stunt!

BRUCE

I warn you I’m no good.

    [_He dances with her, and confirms the truth of his warning._
    CLARA HIBBERT _squashes down on the piano-seat next to_ NICKY
    _and endeavors with one finger in the treble to follow the
    tune he is playing_. HELEN _and_ PAWNIE _stand right down
    close to the footlights, smoking and talking; their backs
    are half turned to the audience, but their remarks must be
    perfectly audible_.]

HELEN

Tom Veryan doesn’t dance as well as he thinks he does.

PAWNIE

With that figure he ought to be marvelous.

HELEN

He’s too athletic.

PAWNIE

Anyhow, I’m sure he’s a success at the Bath Club.

HELEN

Doesn’t Florence look astounding?

PAWNIE

Absolutely. She knows exactly what suits her.

HELEN

Where’s David?

PAWNIE

He went off to his study to smoke.

HELEN

I do wish Florence wouldn’t be irritable with him in front of
everybody. I felt acutely uncomfortable at dinner.

PAWNIE

It makes Nicky furious as a rule, but to-night he was too occupied
with that stupid little fool Bunty Mainwaring to take any notice.

HELEN

She’s an excellent type.

PAWNIE

Very average; I only hope nothing will come of Nicky’s mania for
her.

HELEN

I don’t think we need worry.

PAWNIE

Why?

HELEN

Wait and see, my dear.

CLARA

[_Leaving_ NICKY _at the piano and advancing on_ PAWNIE]

Come and dance, Pawnie, and tell me how divinely I sang on Tuesday.

PAWNIE

[_Agreeably_]

You didn’t.

CLARA

Ten for cruelty.

    [_They start to dance._ HELEN _moves over to the mantelpiece
    for a cigarette_.]

HELEN

Have you a match, Nicky?

NICKY

Isn’t this a marvelous tune?

HELEN

Fascinating! [_She goes over and sits next to him. Gently slipping
her hand into his coat pocket._] Darling, I _do_ want a match. [_She
brings out a little box._] What a divine little box!

    [NICKY _stops playing and jumps up_.]

NICKY

[_Violently_]

Helen, give that to me!----

    [_Everyone stops dancing._]

CLARA

Nicky dear, _don’t_ be tiresome.

NICKY

[_Recovering himself._]

I’m sick of playing. Let’s have the gramophone again. [_To_ HELEN.]
Here’s a light, dearie.

    [_He takes match-box out of another pocket and lights_ HELEN’S
    _cigarette. She looks at him queerly for a moment, then he
    restarts the gramophone and everyone begins to dance again
    except_ HELEN _and_ BRUCE FAIRLIGHT. HELEN _goes over to the
    fireplace and takes a coffee-cup from the mantelpiece_.]

HELEN

Whose coffee is this? Some one drank mine, and I’d hardly touched it.

BRUCE

If it had no sugar in it, it’s mine.

HELEN

[_Draining it_]

It had no sugar in it.

FLORENCE

You’re dancing abominably, Tom.

TOM

Oh, Am I?

FLORENCE

What’s the matter with you?

TOM

I don’t know. I suppose I’m tired.

FLORENCE

You’re not usually tired when you’re dancing with me.

TOM

Oh, Florence, don’t nag!

FLORENCE

How dare you speak to me like that?

    [_She stops dancing and goes over to the fireplace_.]

TOM

[_Following her_]

I say, Florence--I’m sorry----

PAWNIE

Let’s stop the music for a moment and think of something really
marvelous to do.

BUNTY

No, let’s go on dancing.

CLARA

I’m exhausted.

PAWNIE

[_Stopping the gramophone_]

What was that divine game we played coming back from Paris, Helen?

HELEN

Just ordinary “Clumps,” wasn’t it?

BUNTY

I loathe “Clumps.”

NICKY

What about the History game?

BRUCE

What’s that?

BUNTY

Oh no, Nicky; it’s too intellectual.

FLORENCE

There’s a Mah-Jong set in the drawing-room.

PAWNIE

How divine! Let’s make up a table immediately.

CLARA

I won’t be happy until some one gives me a set made entirely of
jade.

NICKY

Come on, Bunty.

BUNTY

[_Looking at_ TOM]

I can’t play it.

NICKY

You can; you used to play in Paris with Yvonne.

BUNTY

I’ve forgotten it.

NICKY

You’ll soon remember again.

    [_He drags her off._]

PAWNIE

Come along, Clara.

CLARA

I insist on Mr. Fairlight learning.

BRUCE

I’m afraid I’m no good at that sort of thing.

CLARA

You’ll be able to put it in one of your plays.

PAWNIE

Come and watch; it’s too thrilling for words.

[CLARA, BRUCE _and_ PAWNIE _go off_.]

HELEN

Have you only one set, Florence?

FLORENCE

Yes. Isn’t it maddening? Clara promised to bring hers down, but
forgot.

HELEN

Does Bruce Fairlight play Bridge?

FLORENCE

No, I don’t think so.

HELEN

Dramatists are such a comfort in a house party, aren’t they?

    [_She goes off._]

TOM

Are you coming, Florence?

FLORENCE

No.

TOM

[_Nonplussed_]

Oh!

FLORENCE

But please don’t let me stop _you_ going. I’m sure you’re _dying_
to be with the others.

TOM

I say, Florence, I wish you wouldn’t go on like that.

FLORENCE

I don’t know what’s the matter with you; you’ve never behaved like
this before.

TOM

I haven’t behaved like anything.

FLORENCE

You’ve been exceedingly rude to me, both at dinner and afterwards.

TOM

I wasn’t at dinner.

FLORENCE

Yes, you were; you snapped me up when I said I didn’t like Elsie
Saunders.

TOM

You know perfectly well she’s a friend of mine.

FLORENCE

Well, she oughtn’t to be, after the things she’s said about me.

TOM

You will go on imagining.

FLORENCE

Nothing of the sort--I _know_! If you weren’t so dense you’d see,
too--the jealousy I have to put up with. I get so tired of it all,
so desperately tired.

    [_She becomes a little pathetic._]

TOM

Talk about being different, you’re different too----

FLORENCE

I’m unhappy.

TOM

Why?

FLORENCE

Because I hate to see you being put against me.

TOM

Florence!

FLORENCE

You’ll understand one day. They’re all very subtle, but I can see.

TOM

Nobody’s said a word to me about you; they’d better not try.

FLORENCE

Why, what would you do?

TOM

I’d--I’d be furious.

FLORENCE

Oh!

TOM

And I’d let them see it, too.

FLORENCE

[_Holding out her hands_]

Tom----

TOM

Yes?

FLORENCE

I forgive you.

TOM

I can’t bear you being angry with me.

FLORENCE

Can’t you, really?

TOM

It makes me feel beastly.

FLORENCE

Come and sit here.

TOM

[_Sitting next to her on the club fender_]

That’s a lovely dress.

FLORENCE

It is sweet, isn’t it?

TOM

You always wear wonderful clothes.

FLORENCE

Do I, Tom?

TOM

You know you do.

FLORENCE

Do you remember the very first time we met?

TOM

Rather.

FLORENCE

Oxford’s so full of romance, isn’t it?

TOM

It was when you came down.

FLORENCE

Thank you, Tom dear.

TOM

We did have fun.

FLORENCE

You used to come up to _matinées_, and I’d motor you back
afterwards.

TOM

Ripping!

FLORENCE

That reminds me, I’ve got seats for “Rolling Stones” on Tuesday.
Don’t forget.

TOM

You never said you were going to get them.

FLORENCE

It doesn’t matter. I thought I did. We’d better dine at Claridges.

TOM

But, Florence, I--I can’t come!

FLORENCE

Why not?

TOM

I promised to go out.

FLORENCE

Who with?

TOM

Mother.

FLORENCE

Can’t you put her off? It will be such a good first night.

TOM

Well--you see, as a matter of fact--it’s rather awkward. I put her
off the other day----

    [_There is a slight pause._]

FLORENCE

[_A trifle coldly_]

Oh, well, never mind, we’ll go some other night.

    [_Enter_ DAVID.]

DAVID

Hallo, Florence! I thought you were in the drawing-room.

FLORENCE

They’re playing Mah-Jong, and there’s only one set. I shall break in
presently.

TOM

I’ll just go and see how they’re getting on.

    [_This obvious excuse for getting out of the room is not lost
    upon_ FLORENCE.]

FLORENCE

Yes, do.

TOM

Come and play soon.

    [_He goes out quietly._]

FLORENCE

Don’t you think this is a divine frock?

DAVID

Very pretty.

FLORENCE

You and Helen seemed to be very thick at dinner. What were you
talking about?

DAVID

Nothing much. I like Helen.

FLORENCE

Only because she flatters you and listens to everything you say.

DAVID

She doesn’t flatter me.

FLORENCE

I suppose she was talking about the farm, and giving her opinions.

DAVID

We did discuss the farm a little.

FLORENCE

She doesn’t know a thing about it, really.

DAVID

Perhaps not, but it passed the time.

    [_He goes out._]

    [FLORENCE _sits still for a moment, then she wearily buries
    her face in her hands. Enter_ NICKY.]

NICKY

[_Going to her_]

What’s the matter, darling?

FLORENCE

Nothing. I’ve got a slight headache.

NICKY

Why don’t you go Byes?

FLORENCE

I can’t; it’s much too early.

NICKY

I’m sick of Mah-Jong.

FLORENCE

Who’s playing now?

NICKY

Pawnie and Helen and Clara are trying to teach Bruce Fairlight;
he’s an awful fool at it.

    [_He sits down at the piano and plays absently._]

FLORENCE

You must get Bunty out of that habit of contradicting everything
people say.

NICKY

I don’t see why.

FLORENCE

It’s bad breeding.

NICKY

[_Striking a note viciously_]

Who cares nowadays? We’ve all got a right to our opinions.

FLORENCE

She seems to forget that I’m much older than she is.

NICKY

That’s no argument, mother; it’s silly only to remember your age
when some one says something you don’t like.

FLORENCE

She’s having a bad effect on you.

NICKY

Nonsense!

FLORENCE

You’ve changed since Paris.

NICKY

Naturally.

FLORENCE

You never used to be rude to me.

NICKY

Oh, damn, I’m not rude.

FLORENCE

Yes, you are.

NICKY

Well, don’t start running down Bunty.

FLORENCE

Stop playing--stop playing!

NICKY

[_Getting up angrily_]

Oh, God!

    [_He goes towards door and collides with_ HELEN.]

HELEN

What’s happening?

FLORENCE

Nothing. Bunty’s just putting Nicky against me. I knew she’d try to.

    [_She goes out._]

HELEN

You must be having a delightful evening! You leave the drawing-room,
having rowed with Bunty, and come here and row with Florence.

NICKY

Mother’s impossible.

HELEN

She’s no different from what she’s always been.

NICKY

Well, I haven’t realized it before.

HELEN

[_Taking a cigarette and lighting it_]

You haven’t been engaged before.

NICKY

I’m hating this house party.

HELEN

[_Lightly_]

Don’t say that, dear; it’s not kind.

NICKY

You know I don’t mean you.

HELEN

Are you very much in love?

NICKY

Yes.--No.--I don’t know.

HELEN

I wonder.

NICKY

It’s utterly devastating, anyhow.

HELEN

When did you meet her?

NICKY

About five months ago.

HELEN

What was she doing in Paris?

NICKY

Oh, I don’t know--fooling about.

HELEN

Splendid.

NICKY

She’s been studying French literature.

HELEN

Why?

NICKY

She’s going to write--herself--some day.

HELEN

Oh, I see!

NICKY

Helen, do you like her?

HELEN

I can’t tell yet--yesterday was the first time I’d ever set eyes on
her.

NICKY

She’s wonderfully intelligent.

HELEN

Yes--I’m sure she is.

NICKY

You _don’t_ like her?

HELEN

I tell you--I’m not sure yet.

NICKY

It’s generally the way--one’s friends always hate one another.

HELEN

[_Smiling_]

It _is_ difficult for you, isn’t it?

NICKY

I should so like you to like her.

HELEN

Very well--I’ll try.

NICKY

She’s utterly opposite to me in every way.

HELEN

Yes, I see that.

NICKY

But that’s as it ought to be, isn’t it?

HELEN

It depends.

NICKY

I need a sort of restraining influence terribly.

HELEN

Yes, Nicky.

NICKY

She’s awfully good for me.

HELEN

Is she?

NICKY

Yes--she curbs me when I get temperamental and silly.

HELEN

I always felt you needed encouraging more than curbing.

NICKY

[_Laughing_]

Oh, Helen--aren’t you a darling!

HELEN

I mean it.

NICKY

You’re wrong, though--I’m all over the place.

HELEN

Anyhow, I do hope you’ll be very happy with her.

NICKY

I don’t suppose I shall ever be that. I haven’t got the knack.

HELEN

Do you work hard?

NICKY

Yes.

HELEN

Really hard?

NICKY

Frightfully.

HELEN

Liar!

NICKY

If you’d seen me in Paris--studying, studying--all night long until
the gray dawn put the guttering candle to shame--and my nerveless
hands dropped from the keys----

HELEN

Candles gutter awfully quickly when they’re burned at both ends.

NICKY

Meaning that I look a debauched wreck of my former self?

HELEN

Exactly.

NICKY

If you go on encouraging me at this rate I shall commit suicide.

HELEN

You do resent anyone taking a real interest in you, don’t you?

NICKY

I distrust it.

HELEN

Why?

NICKY

I don’t know--I’m not worth it.

HELEN

You seem to be suffering from a slight inferiority complex.

NICKY

Not a bit of it--I’m gay and witty and handsome.

HELEN

Oh, Nicky, you’re so maddening.

NICKY

Don’t be cross, Helen.

HELEN

I’m one of the few people who know what you’re really like, and you
won’t give me the credit for it.

NICKY

Do you think you do, honestly?

HELEN

Yes--and I’m exceedingly worried about you.

NICKY

You needn’t be.

HELEN

You’re sensitive and reserved and utterly foolish.

NICKY

Thank you--I’m beginning to feel beautifully picturesque.

HELEN

And you’re scared.

NICKY

Why! What have I to be scared about?

HELEN

Would you like me to tell you?

NICKY

No.

HELEN

Why not?

NICKY

Because you’re a sentimentalist, and you see things that aren’t
there at all.

HELEN

You’re far more sentimental than I.

NICKY

Darling Helen--you’ve got such a lovely mind--like a Christmas
card--with frosted robins and sheep wandering about in the
snow--bleating.

HELEN

All the same, I should give up drugs if I were you.

NICKY

Helen!

HELEN

Well?

NICKY

I don’t know what you mean.

HELEN

Do you think I can’t see?

NICKY

[_Forcing a laugh_]

You’re being terribly funny, aren’t you?

HELEN

You fool! You unutterable little fool!

NICKY

Don’t be dramatic, dear.

HELEN

I thought you had common sense; I credited you with more
intelligence than that.

NICKY

If you persist in being absurd.

HELEN

[_Suddenly with intense feeling_]

Nicky, don’t resist me, don’t fight me; I’m your friend; I wouldn’t
have said a word if I weren’t. You’ve got to stop it; you haven’t
gone very far yet; there’s still time. For God’s sake listen to
reason.

NICKY

Shut up, shut up, don’t speak so loudly.

HELEN

Nicky, throw it away.

NICKY

When did you find out?

HELEN

To-night, you know, when you were playing, but I’ve guessed for
ages.

NICKY

You needn’t be frightened, Helen; I only take just the tiniest
little bit, once in a blue moon!

HELEN

If anything goes wrong, you’ll take a lot. Throw it away.

NICKY

What could go wrong?

HELEN

Never mind, throw it away!

NICKY

I can’t. Look out; somebody’s coming.

    [_Enter_ DAVID.]

DAVID

Hallo!

NICKY

Hallo, father!

DAVID

What’s the matter?

NICKY

The matter--why?

DAVID

You look very worried.

NICKY

Helen and I have just had a grand heart-to-heart talk; we’ve undone
our back hair, loosened our stays and wallowed in it.

DAVID

Oh, I see!

HELEN

We haven’t seen one another for so long--it was inevitable.

DAVID

You never came and looked at the farm this morning. I waited for
you.

NICKY

I’m awfully sorry, father--I just went on sleeping.

HELEN

I’ll see you later, Nicky.

NICKY

All right.

    [HELEN _goes out_.]

DAVID

How do you think your mother’s looking?

NICKY

Splendid--the same as ever.

DAVID

Would you like a cigar?

NICKY

No, thanks, father--I’m not very good at them.

DAVID

I was just on my way to bed--there are far too many people in the
house.

NICKY

[_Smiling_]

You must be used to that by now.

DAVID

You ought to stay down here, you know--during the week, and get some
fresh air.

NICKY

I’ve got such millions of things to do in London.

DAVID

Worth doing?

NICKY

Yes, of course.

DAVID

You look as though you needed a rest.

NICKY

You needn’t worry about me--I feel splendid.

DAVID

She seems a nice girl.

NICKY

Who--Bunty?

DAVID

Yes. Quiet and untiresome.

NICKY

She’s a darling!

DAVID

When do you propose to get married?

NICKY

I don’t know. The engagement’s only a sort of try out, you know.

DAVID

Oh, I see. I didn’t realize that. I’m so unversed in modern
technicalities.

NICKY

It’s her idea really--just to tread water for a bit.

DAVID

It sounds an excellent plan.

NICKY

I’m awfully glad you like her.

DAVID

Is she musical?

NICKY

Oh, yes--frightfully!

DAVID

Good!

NICKY

Father, I think I will come down here for a few days--and work
quietly.

DAVID

If you do that I’ll go up to London every other day. I see so little
of you when you’re at the flat.

NICKY

That’s settled then. I wonder what mother will say!

DAVID

I’ll talk to her.

NICKY

All right. She won’t bother about us much.

DAVID

No--I don’t suppose she will. I think I’ll be getting along to bed
now. Good night, my boy!

NICKY

Good night, father!

    [_They shake hands, and_ DAVID _pats_ NICKY’S _shoulder rather
    tentatively. He goes upstairs and_ NICKY _wanders to the piano.
    He plays absently, and_ BUNTY _enters_.]

BUNTY

I want to talk to you.

NICKY

[_Still playing_]

All right.

BUNTY

Perhaps you’d stop playing for a minute.

NICKY

Won’t you let me woo you with a little Scriabine?

BUNTY

Please stop.

NICKY

[_Rising_]

I’m unappreciated--that’s what it is.

    [_There is a slight pause--he goes over to her._]

I say, Bunty----

BUNTY

What?

NICKY

Before you say anything awful to me, I _am_ sorry for being rude
just now.

BUNTY

So you ought to be.

NICKY

Will you forgive me?

BUNTY

Yes, I forgive you.

NICKY

I’ve been irritable all the evening.

BUNTY

Give me a cigarette, Nicky.

NICKY

Here.

    [_They both smoke._]

BUNTY

Thanks.

NICKY

What did you want to talk to me about?

BUNTY

Lots of things--us!

NICKY

[_Hardening_]

Oh, I see!

BUNTY

Don’t you think it’s rather silly--being engaged?

NICKY

No, not at all.

BUNTY

I do.

NICKY

Just because we bickered a bit to-night?

BUNTY

No, not only because of that.

NICKY

Why then?

BUNTY

Can’t you see?

NICKY

No.

BUNTY

Well, we’re not very suited to each other, are we?

NICKY

Why do you suddenly say that?

BUNTY

Because I’ve only just realized it.

NICKY

I’m sorry.

BUNTY

It’s not your fault particularly.

NICKY

I’m glad.

BUNTY

It’s circumstances and surroundings.

NICKY

Oh, that can be altered quite easily. We’ll change the shape of
the house--we’ll take all that wall away and turn that into a
studio--you love studios, don’t you?--then we’ll transform the
drawing-room into an enormous aviary.

BUNTY

It’s practically that now!

NICKY

And then we’ll----

BUNTY

Shut up, Nicky!

NICKY

I’m only trying to be amenable.

BUNTY

Are you, really?

NICKY

Yes, I’m putting up a sort of defense, Bunty. I have a feeling that
you’re going to be unpleasant, and I want to establish myself
comfortably before you start.

BUNTY

I don’t want to be unpleasant--only honest.

NICKY

You won’t let the two run together, will you?

BUNTY

[_With vehemence_]

You’re hopeless, hopeless, hopeless!

NICKY

Yes--I think I am, rather.

BUNTY

In a way I’m glad--it makes it easier.

NICKY

Does it?

BUNTY

You’re not in love with me, really--you couldn’t be!

NICKY

Please don’t say that.

BUNTY

Why don’t you face things properly?

NICKY

One generally has to in the end. I like to put it off for as long as
possible.

BUNTY

That’s cowardly.

NICKY

Don’t be pompous, darling.

BUNTY

You’re a great help, I must say.

NICKY

Why should I help to destroy my own happiness?

BUNTY

That’s self-pity and self-deception.

NICKY

Why are you going on like this?

BUNTY

Because I tell you--I’ve realized the truth.

NICKY

I suppose you’ve taken a hatred to mother!

BUNTY

No, not a hatred.

NICKY

You don’t like her.

BUNTY

Not very much.

NICKY

Why not? She likes you.

BUNTY

She detests me.

NICKY

Nonsense! Why should she?

BUNTY

Because I’m young.

NICKY

What a filthy thing to say!

BUNTY

It’s true.

NICKY

It’s nothing of the sort.

BUNTY

You’re so stupid sometimes.

NICKY

Thank you.

BUNTY

Don’t let’s start bickering again.

NICKY

We won’t discuss mother any more then.

BUNTY

You started it.

NICKY

I wish I could make you understand her like I do. I mean she’s
awfully irritating, I know--but deep down she’s marvelous in spite
of everything.

BUNTY

[_Coldly_]

Everything?

NICKY

[_Vehemently_]

Yes, _everything_! Don’t be a beast, Bunty; just try to see her
point a little, even if you do dislike her. She is terribly silly
about being “young,” I know, but she’s been used to so much
admiration and flattery and everything always, she feels she sort
of can’t give it up--you do see that, don’t you? And she hasn’t
really anything in the least comforting to fall back upon. She’s
not clever--real kind of brain cleverness--and father’s no good,
and I’m no good, and all the time she’s wanting life to be as it
was instead of as it is. There’s no harm in her anywhere--she’s
just young inside. Can’t you imagine the utter foulness of growing
old? ’Specially if you’ve been lovely and attractive like she was.
The beautiful Flo Lancaster! She used to be known as that. I can
remember her when I was quite small, coming up to say good night to
me, looking too perfectly radiant for words--and she used to come
to the school, too, sometimes, and everyone used to go mad over
her, and I used to get frightfully proud and excited----

BUNTY

I’ve never heard you talk like this before.

NICKY

I don’t think I ever have.

BUNTY

I like you better clear cut, not blurred by sentiment.

    [NICKY _looks at her for a moment in amazement_.]

NICKY

To describe you as hard would be inadequate--you’re metallic!

BUNTY

I can see straight.

NICKY

[_Politely_]

Can you?

BUNTY

Yes. We could never be happy together.

NICKY

Perhaps not.

BUNTY

Shall we just--finish--then?

NICKY

Certainly, I’m sorry we were too modern to have an engagement ring;
you’d have been able to give it back to me so beautifully.

BUNTY

Don’t be ridiculous!

NICKY

Better than being blurred by sentiment.

    [BUNTY _lights another cigarette and, kicking off her shoes,
    perches on the club fender and proceeds to warm her feet at
    the fire_.]

    [_Enter_ CLARA HIBBERT.]

CLARA

My dear, I’m _shattered_--and I’m going straight to bed--probably
for several weeks.

BUNTY

Why?

CLARA

Shshsh! He’s coming.

BUNTY

Who’s coming?

CLARA

Bruce Fairlight. I’ve been teaching him Mah-Jong. These master
brains--agony, dear----

    [_Enter_ BRUCE FAIRLIGHT.]

BRUCE

Very interesting, that game.

CLARA

[_Weakly_]

I thought you’d like it.

BRUCE

It’s interesting _psychologically_! The concentration and
suspense----

    [_Enter_ FLORENCE, HELEN, PAWNIE _and_ TOM. TOM _is grasping a
    whisky and soda_--PAWNIE _is eating a biscuit_.]

PAWNIE

I’m quite exhausted; it must be the country air----

FLORENCE

--It was too lovely, because I started with two red dragons in my
hand----

HELEN

I wondered who had them----

PAWNIE

One more tune, Nicky, before we go to bed----

FLORENCE

Yes, just one----

NICKY

[_Looking at_ BUNTY]

I’ll play “I love you”--such a romantic tune.

    [_He puts on the gramophone._]

BUNTY

Do.

HELEN

What time’s everyone going up in the morning?

FLORENCE

The ten-o’clock’s the best--we’ll have breakfast at nine downstairs.

PAWNIE

[_Confidentially_]

Do you know that in London I can never do more than nibble a piece
of thin toast, and whenever I’m away I eat _enormously_!

NICKY

How very peculiar!

PAWNIE

Your tone revolts me, Nicky. You must never be irascible with your
old friends.

NICKY

I haven’t got any.

HELEN

Nicky!

NICKY

Sorry, Helen.

FLORENCE

I don’t know what’s the matter with Nicky. He’s been in a vile
temper all the evening--his first week-end home, too.

NICKY

Such a pity, when so much trouble has been taken to make me happy
and cozy.

TOM

Come and dance, Bunty.

BUNTY

No, not now.

NICKY

Dance with him, Bunty. Chaps must have exercise.

FLORENCE

You dance with Bunty, Pawnie--I’ll dance with Tom--come on.

    [_She and_ TOM _dance_.]

HELEN

The great thing in this world is not to be obvious, Nicky--over
_anything_!

    [FLORENCE _and_ TOM _dance, also_ HELEN _and_ PAWNIE.
    _Everyone talks at once, as in the beginning of the act._]

PAWNIE

You are infuriating, Helen. It’s a wonderful book.

HELEN

Thoroughly second-rate.

PAWNIE

What do you think about _Mischievous Passion_, Fairlight?

BRUCE

I never read novels on principle.

PAWNIE

Well, you must read this--it’s colossal.

HELEN

Don’t be led away by Pawnie, Mr. Fairlight, he has no discrimination.

PAWNIE

But I tell you it’s brilliant! Absolutely _brilliant!_

HELEN

Nonsense.

PAWNIE

There are times, Helen, when I could willingly see you dead at my
feet.

FLORENCE

A little slower, for Heaven’s sake!

NICKY

How’s that?

    [_He makes it far too slow._]

FLORENCE

I think you’d better go to bed, Nicky.

HELEN

We’re all going, anyhow.

NICKY

Not yet, please, mummy dear--I’m having such a lovely time!

    [_He slams off in a rage._]

PAWNIE

I always knew the Continent was fatal for the young.

BUNTY

Nicky’s upset--it’s my fault--we’re not engaged any more.

FLORENCE

Why--what’s happened?

BUNTY

Nothing happened--it was never very serious, really.

HELEN

I had a feeling that it was.

BUNTY

You were wrong.

FLORENCE

Well, I must say it’s all been rather abrupt.

BUNTY

It’s better to finish things off at once--cleanly--if you’re not
quite sure, don’t you think?

FLORENCE

Well, I’m sorry, Bunty. If you feel like that about it there’s
nothing more to be said.

BUNTY

I wouldn’t have mentioned it at all--only you all seemed to be
blaming him for being irritable----

HELEN

Poor Nicky!

CLARA

I really must go up to bed now. I’m so tired. Good night, Florence
dear.

FLORENCE

Good night, Clara. Breakfast at nine. Have you got books and
everything you want?

CLARA

Yes, thanks. Good night, everyone.

    [_Everyone murmurs good night politely._]

FLORENCE

Tom, be an angel and fetch me a glass of milk. It’s in the
drawing-room.

TOM

All right.

    [_He goes off._]

HELEN

Come on up, Florence. I’m dead.

FLORENCE

So am I. Will you turn out the lights when you come?

PAWNIE

With beautiful precision, dear.

FLORENCE

[_As she and_ HELEN _go upstairs_]

Tell Tom to bring my milk up to me, somebody.

PAWNIE

All right.

FLORENCE

Good night, Mr. Fairlight.

BRUCE

Good night.

PAWNIE

Good night, Florence.

    [FLORENCE _and_ HELEN _go off_.]

BRUCE

I suppose we’d all better go up.

BUNTY

I don’t feel I could sleep yet.

    [_Re-enter_ TOM _with glass of milk_.]

TOM

Hallo! Where’s Florence?

BUNTY

Gone up to bed. Will you take her milk to her?

PAWNIE

What’s become of Nicky?

TOM

In the smoking-room, I think.

BRUCE

Good night, Miss Mainwaring.

BUNTY

Good night.

    [_They shake hands._]

PAWNIE

I shall come, too--good night.

TOM

Good night.

PAWNIE

[_To_ BRUCE _as they go upstairs_]

When you’re writing, do your characters grow as you go along?

BRUCE

No, I think each one out minutely beforehand.

PAWNIE

How too intriguing.

    [_They go off._]

TOM

So you’ve broken it off already?

BUNTY

Yes.

TOM

I didn’t know you were going to do it so soon.

BUNTY

It’s better to get things over.

TOM

What did he say?

BUNTY

Nothing much.

TOM

Was he furious?

BUNTY

Oh, what does it matter? Don’t let’s go on about it.

TOM

It’s all damned awkward.

BUNTY

What?

TOM

The whole thing.

BUNTY

You’re rather scared, aren’t you?

TOM

No, not exactly--now that I’ve got you to back me up.

BUNTY

I shall be glad when we’re out of this house.

TOM

So shall I.

BUNTY

I hate the atmosphere.

TOM

I don’t know how I’ve stood it for so long.

BUNTY

You didn’t notice it until I came, any more than I noticed Nicky’s
atmosphere until you came.

TOM

It’s queer, isn’t it?

BUNTY

We’re reverting to type, don’t you see?

TOM

How d’ye mean?

BUNTY

Never mind, it’s true.

TOM

Do you think I’m being a cad to Florence?

BUNTY

Yes, I do rather.

TOM

But, Bunty! You said this morning----

BUNTY

That I didn’t see how you could help yourself; neither I do. It’s
frightfully difficult, but it’s not altogether your fault, any more
than it would have been mine if I’d married Nicky. One gets carried
away by glamour, and personality, and magnetism--they’re beastly
treacherous things.

TOM

You are wonderful.

BUNTY

Don’t be silly.

TOM

You’re so cool and clear, and you see everything.

BUNTY

I’m sorry--for Nicky.

TOM

Oh, damn Nicky!

BUNTY

[_Laughing_]

Oh, Tom!

TOM

Why, what’s up?

BUNTY

You’re so dead set.

TOM

You’re worth ten of him any day. What’s the use of a chap like
that? He _doesn’t do_ anything except play the piano--he can’t play
any games, he’s always trying to be funny----

BUNTY

Shut up, Tom; you’re being rather cheap. I haven’t reverted to type
so quickly that I can’t see some of the things I’m missing.

TOM

I wish I knew what you were talking about.

BUNTY

Oh, God! I feel so miserable!

    [_She burst into tears._]

TOM

[_Flummoxed_]

I say--Bunty--for Heaven’s sake----

    [_He puts his arm round her._]

BUNTY

[_Shaking him off_]

Don’t, don’t. Give me my shoes----

    [_He picks up her shoes; she puts them on. She is half sobbing
    all the time._]

TOM

I say, old girl, hadn’t you better go to bed? You’re all wrought up!

BUNTY

He said beastly things.

TOM

I’ll wring his neck.

BUNTY

[_With a fresh burst of tears_]

Shut up, Tom, shut up----

TOM

Bunty, stop crying--there’s a dear; please, please stop crying----

    [_He takes her in his arms and kisses her; she is groping for
    her handkerchief._ FLORENCE _comes quietly downstairs_.]

BUNTY

I can’t find my hanky!

TOM

Here’s mine.

FLORENCE

[_Like a pistol shot_]

Tom!

    [TOM _and_ BUNTY _break away_.]

TOM

Yes, Florence?

FLORENCE

[_Ominously_]

What does this mean?

TOM

I’m sorry, Florence--I----

FLORENCE

You utter cad!

BUNTY

Look here--I should like to say----

FLORENCE

Be quiet--mind your own business.

    [NICKY _enters_.]

NICKY

[_Seeing tears on_ BUNTY’S _face_]

What’s the matter--is anybody hurt?

FLORENCE

[_Ominously_]

No, not hurt!

BUNTY

I banged my hand, that’s all.

FLORENCE

Liar!

NICKY

Mother--don’t be so stupid----

TOM

Florence--I----

FLORENCE

Don’t _speak_ to me----

NICKY

[_Quietly_]

Mother--not now--not now--it’s all wrong. Control yourself!
Bunty--Bunty--do go to bed--please.

    [_He goes to the piano and begins to play jazz._]

BUNTY

All right--Tom----

    [FLORENCE _goes to the fireplace, trembling with rage_. NICKY
    _goes on playing_. TOM _and_ BUNTY _go towards the stairs_.]

FLORENCE

Stop--I want an explanation, please!

BUNTY

How dare you speak to me like that?

FLORENCE

Get out of my house! Get out of my house!

BUNTY

This is disgusting!

TOM

I say, Florence----

FLORENCE

Get out of my house!

BUNTY

I shall leave the first thing in the morning; it’s much too late
to-night.

    [_She goes off._]

    [NICKY _never stops playing for a moment_.]

FLORENCE

Tom. [_He goes towards her, absolutely silent._] You kissed
her--you kissed her--I saw you!----

TOM

Yes.

FLORENCE

In this house!

TOM

Yes, Florence. I apologize.

FLORENCE

Apologize! You’re beneath contempt. Never speak to me again, never
touch me again--I hate you!

TOM

Look here, Florence--I’m desperately sorry. You see, I’m afraid I
love her.

FLORENCE

[_Hysterically_]

You dare to stand there and say that to me? It’s incredible--after
all I’ve done for you--after all we’ve been to each other. Love!
You don’t know what it means. You’ve lied to me--all these months.
It’s contemptible--humiliating. Get out of my sight!

TOM

[_Turning and going upstairs_]

Very well.

FLORENCE

[_Suddenly realizing that he is gone_]

Tom--Tom--come back--come back!----

    [_She runs upstairs after him._ NICKY _at last stops playing
    and lets his hands drop from the keys_.]

CURTAIN




ACT III




ACT III


_The scene is_ FLORENCE’S _bedroom the same night. About two
hours have elapsed. When the curtain rises_ FLORENCE _is lying
face downwards on the bed; she is dressed in a very beautiful but
slightly exotic négligé_.

HELEN _is standing by the window, fully dressed; she is holding
the curtain aside, and a bar of moonlight comes in to mingle with
the amber of the dressing-table lights_. FLORENCE _is obviously
extremely hysterical_.

HELEN

Florence, what _is_ the use of going on like that?

FLORENCE

I wish I were dead!

HELEN

It’s so cowardly to give way utterly--as you’re doing.

FLORENCE

I don’t care--I don’t care!

HELEN

If you don’t face things in this world, they only hit you much
harder in the end.

FLORENCE

He loved me--he adored me!

HELEN

Never! He hadn’t got it in him.

FLORENCE

After all I’ve done for him, to go to--to Bunty!

HELEN

[_Leaving the window_]

If it hadn’t been Bunty it would have been some one else--don’t you
see how inevitable it was?

FLORENCE

How dared they!--Here!--In this house!

HELEN

That’s a little thing; it doesn’t matter at all.

FLORENCE

It does--it does----

HELEN

Florence, sit up and pull yourself together.

FLORENCE

[_Sitting up slowly_]

I think I’m going mad.

HELEN

Not a bit of it; you’re just thoroughly hysterical.

FLORENCE

Give me some water.

    [HELEN _goes to the bathroom and returns with a glass of
    water_.]

FLORENCE

[_Taking it_]

What time is it?

HELEN

[_Looking at her watch_]

Ten past one.

FLORENCE

Don’t go to London by the early train, Helen; stay and come up with
me in the car.

HELEN

Very well.

FLORENCE

Thank God, you were here!

HELEN

I wish I’d known what was happening; I might have done something.

FLORENCE

What can I do to get him back?

HELEN

Don’t be silly.

FLORENCE

What can I do--what can I do?----

HELEN

Do you mean to say you’d _take_ him back after to-night?

FLORENCE

No, never. Not if he crawled to me--never----

HELEN

Well, then, make up your mind definitely never to see him again
whatever happens.

FLORENCE

Yes--I will.

HELEN

Why don’t you go to bed now?

FLORENCE

I couldn’t sleep.

HELEN

Put it all out of your mind--make an effort.

FLORENCE

I can’t--I’m too unhappy.

HELEN

Think of Nicky.

FLORENCE

Nicky’s young.

HELEN

That doesn’t make it any better for him.

FLORENCE

He’ll get over it in the long run.

HELEN

The long run never counts at the moment.

FLORENCE

He wasn’t in love--really?

HELEN

As much as either you or he are capable of it.

FLORENCE

He’s well rid of her. She’d never have appreciated him properly--she
hasn’t the intelligence.

HELEN

I don’t agree with you there--she’s got intelligence right enough.

FLORENCE

Treacherous little beast!

HELEN

Yes, but far-seeing.

FLORENCE

Are you standing up for her? Do you think it was _right_ of her to
get Tom away from me?

HELEN

Yes, quite right.

FLORENCE

Helen!

HELEN

To do her justice, she didn’t deliberately set herself out to get
him away from you at all. She discovered that in spite of the
somewhat decadent years Tom was still her type, and likely to remain
so. So with common sense she decided to shelve Nicky forthwith and go
for him.

FLORENCE

Her type indeed!

HELEN

Yes, she’d have been quite a nice girl really if she’d been left
alone and not allowed to go to Paris and get into the wrong set.

FLORENCE

You are extraordinary, Helen. Do you realize that you’re making
excuses for the girl who’s betrayed your best friend?

HELEN

Don’t be so utterly absurd. I’m not making excuses, and, anyhow,
she hasn’t betrayed you. She hardly knows you, in the first place,
and she’s just followed her instincts regardless of anyone else’s
feelings--as you’ve done thousands of times.

FLORENCE

Helen--you’re being horrible to me!

HELEN

I’m not, I’m trying to make you see! You’re battering your head
against silly cast-iron delusions, and I want to dislodge them.

FLORENCE

Helen, I’m so unhappy--so desperately unhappy.

HELEN

Yes, but not because you’ve lost Tom; it’s something far deeper than
that.

FLORENCE

What then?

HELEN

You’re on the wrong tack, and have been for years.

FLORENCE

I don’t understand.

HELEN

You _won’t_ understand!

    [FLORENCE _gets off the bed and goes over to the dressing-table.
    She sits and stares at herself in the glass for a moment without
    speaking._]

FLORENCE

My eyes are sore. [_She powders her face and sprays a little scent
on her hair._] It’s so lovely this--and so refreshing.

HELEN

I think I’ll go to bed now.

FLORENCE

No, wait a little longer with me--please, Helen--just a few minutes.

HELEN

It’s so hot in here.

FLORENCE

Open the window then.

HELEN

All right.

    [_She goes to the window and opens it._ FLORENCE _takes a
    cigarette out of a box and then shakes a scent-bottle and
    rubs the cigarette lightly with the stopper_.]

FLORENCE

Do you ever do this? It’s divine.

HELEN

What a wonderfully clear night. You can see the hills right across
the valley--the moon’s quite strong.

    [FLORENCE _goes to the window and stands next to_ HELEN,
    _looking out--she is puffing her cigarette_.]

FLORENCE

I chose this room in the first place because the view was so lovely.

HELEN

Do you ever look at it?

FLORENCE

[_Listlessly_]

Of course I do, often!

HELEN

It’s been raining. I wish you’d throw away that cigarette--it spoils
the freshness.

FLORENCE

[_Turning away_]

It’s soothing me--calming my nerves.

HELEN

I do wish I could help you--really!

FLORENCE

You are helping me, darling--you’re being an angel.

HELEN

[_Suddenly angry_]

Don’t talk so emptily, Florence; I’m worth more than that.

FLORENCE

I don’t know what you mean.

HELEN

It sickens me to see you getting back so soon.

FLORENCE

Getting back?

HELEN

Yes, to your usual worthless attitude of mind.

FLORENCE

Helen!

HELEN

A little while ago you were really suffering for once, and in a way
I was glad because it showed you were capable of a genuine emotion.
Now you’re glossing it over--swarming it down with your returning
vanity; soon you won’t be unhappy any more--just vindictive.

FLORENCE

Don’t go on at me like that--I’m too wretched.

HELEN

[_Going to her_]

Florence dear, forgive me, but it’s true--and I don’t want it to
be.

    [_The door opens and_ NICKY _enters. He is in dressing-gown
    and pyjamas. His face looks strained and white._]

FLORENCE

Nicky!

NICKY

Helen, I want to talk to mother, please.

HELEN

All right, Nicky.

FLORENCE

What is it?

NICKY

I couldn’t sleep.

HELEN

Florence dear--good night.

FLORENCE

No--no, Helen--don’t go yet----

HELEN

I must.

FLORENCE

Helen--stay with me.

NICKY

Please go.

HELEN

I can’t stay, Florence--it’s quite impossible.

    [_She goes out._]

FLORENCE

I don’t know what you mean--by coming here and ordering Helen out of
my room.

NICKY

I’m sorry, mother. I felt I had to talk to you alone.

FLORENCE

At this hour of the night? You’re mad!

NICKY

No, I’m not; I think I’m probably more unhappy than I’ve ever been
in my life.

FLORENCE

You’re young--you’ll get over it.

NICKY

I hope so.

FLORENCE

I knew the first moment I saw her--what sort of a girl she was.

NICKY

Oh, mother!

FLORENCE

It’s true. I had an _instinct_ about her.

NICKY

It’s all been rather a shock, you know----

FLORENCE

[_Becoming motherly_]

Yes, dear--I know--I know--but you mustn’t be miserable about her;
she isn’t worth it. [_She goes to kiss him._]

NICKY

[_Gently pushing her away_]

Don’t, mother!

FLORENCE

Listen, Nicky. Go back to bed now--there’s a dear; my head’s
splitting.

NICKY

I can’t yet.

FLORENCE

Take some aspirin; that’ll calm your nerves.

NICKY

I’m afraid I’m a little beyond aspirin.

FLORENCE

I don’t want you to think I don’t sympathize with you, darling--my
heart _aches_ for you--I know so well what you’re going through.

NICKY

Do you?

FLORENCE

It’s agony--absolute agony--but, you see--it will wear off--it
always does in time. [NICKY _doesn’t answer_.] Nicky, please go now!

NICKY

I want to talk to you.

FLORENCE

To-morrow--we’ll talk to-morrow.

NICKY

No, now--_now_!

FLORENCE

You’re inconsiderate and cruel--I’ve told you my head’s bursting.

NICKY

I want to sympathize with you, too--and try to understand
everything--as well as I can----

FLORENCE

Understand everything?

NICKY

Yes, please.

FLORENCE

I don’t know what you mean----

NICKY

Will you tell me things--as though I were somebody quite different?

FLORENCE

What kind of things?

NICKY

Things about you--your life.

FLORENCE

Really, Nicky--you’re ridiculous--asking me to tell you stories at
this hour!

NICKY

[_With dead vehemence_]

Mother--sit down quietly. I’m not going out of this room until I’ve
got everything straight in my mind.

FLORENCE

[_Sinking down--almost hypnotized_]

Nicky--please--I----

NICKY

Tom Veryan has been your lover, hasn’t he?

FLORENCE

[_Almost shrieking_]

Nicky--how dare you!

NICKY

Keep calm--it’s our only chance--keep calm.

FLORENCE

[_Bursting into tears_]

How dare you speak to me like that--suggest such a thing! I----

NICKY

It’s true, isn’t it?

FLORENCE

Go away--go away!

NICKY

It’s true, isn’t it?

FLORENCE

No--no!

NICKY

It’s true, isn’t it?

FLORENCE

No--I tell you--no--no--no!

NICKY

You’re lying to me, mother. What’s the use of that?

FLORENCE

You’re mad--mad----

NICKY

Does father know?

FLORENCE

Go away!

NICKY

Does father know?

FLORENCE

Your father knows nothing--he doesn’t understand me any more than
you do.

NICKY

Then it’s between us alone.

FLORENCE

I tell you I don’t know what you’re talking about.

NICKY

Mother--don’t go on like that; it’s useless. We’ve arrived at a
crisis; wherever we go--whatever we do we can’t escape from it.
I know we’re neither of us very strong-minded or capable, and
we haven’t much hope of coming through successfully--but let’s
try. It’s no good pretending any more--our lives are built up of
pretenses all the time. For years--ever since I began to think at
all, I’ve been bolstering up my illusions about you. People have
made remarks, not realizing that I was your son, and I’ve pretended
that they were inspired by cattiness and jealousy. I’ve noticed
things--trivial incriminating little incidents, and I’ve brushed
them aside and not thought any more about them because you were my
mother--clever and beautiful and successful--and naturally people
_would_ slander you _because_ you were so beautiful--and now I
_know_--they were right!

FLORENCE

Nicky--I implore you--go away now--leave me alone.

NICKY

No, I can’t.

FLORENCE

You’re cruel--cruel to torment me----

NICKY

I don’t want to be cruel----

FLORENCE

Go to bed then, and we’ll talk everything over quietly another time.

NICKY

It is true about Tom Veryan, isn’t it?

FLORENCE

No. No----

NICKY

We’re on awfully dangerous ground. I’m straining every nerve to keep
myself under control. If you lie to me and try to evade me any
more--I won’t be answerable for what might happen.

FLORENCE

[_Dropping her voice--terrified_]

What do you mean?

NICKY

I don’t know--I’m frightened.

FLORENCE

Nicky--darling Nicky--I----

    [_She approaches him._]

NICKY

Don’t touch me, please.

FLORENCE

Have a little pity for me.

NICKY

Was Tom Veryan your lover?

FLORENCE

[_In a whisper_]

Yes.

NICKY

I want to understand why----

FLORENCE

He loved me.

NICKY

But you--did you love him?

FLORENCE

Yes.

NICKY

It was something you couldn’t help, wasn’t it--something that’s
always been the same in you since you were quite, quite young?----

FLORENCE

Yes, Nicky--yes----

NICKY

And there have been others, too, haven’t there?

FLORENCE

[_With her face in her hands_]

I won’t be cross-questioned any more--I won’t--I won’t----

NICKY

I wish you’d understand I’m not blaming you--I’m trying to help
you--to help us both----

FLORENCE

What good can all this possibly do?

NICKY

Clear things up, of course. I can’t go on any more half knowing----

FLORENCE

Why should that side of my life be any concern of yours?

NICKY

But, mother!

FLORENCE

I’m different from other women--completely different--and you expect
me to be the same. Why can’t you realize that with a temperament
like mine it’s impossible to live an ordinary humdrum life. You’re
not a boy any longer--you’re a man--and----

NICKY

I’m nothing--I’ve grown up all wrong.

FLORENCE

It’s not my fault.

NICKY

Of course it’s your fault, mother--who else’s fault _could_ it be?

FLORENCE

Your friends--the people you mix with----

NICKY

It wouldn’t matter _who_ I mixed with if only I had a background.

FLORENCE

You’ve got as much money as you want--you’ve got your home----

NICKY

[_Bitterly_]

Home! That’s almost funny--there’s no peace anywhere--nothing but
the ceaseless din of trying to be amused----

FLORENCE

David never complains.

NICKY

I don’t suppose you’ve looked at father during the last few years--or
you wouldn’t say that.

FLORENCE

He’s perfectly happy because he’s sensible--he lives his own life
and doesn’t try to interfere with mine.

NICKY

It must be your vanity that makes you so dreadfully blind--and
foolish.

FLORENCE

Understand once and for all, I _won’t_ be spoken to like this----

NICKY

You’ve had other lovers besides Tom Veryan--haven’t you?

FLORENCE

Yes, I have--I have. Now then!

NICKY

Well, anyhow--that’s the truth--at last----

    [_He rises, turns his back on her and stands looking out of
    the window._]

FLORENCE

[_After a pause--going to him_]

Nicky--don’t be angry--please don’t be angry with me.

NICKY

I’m not angry a bit. I realize that I’m living in a world where
things like this happen--and they’ve got to be faced and given the
right value. If only I’d had the courage to realize everything
before--it wouldn’t be so bad now. It’s the sudden shock that’s
thrown the whole thing out of focus for me--but I mean to get it
right. Please help me!

FLORENCE

[_Dully_]

I don’t know what to do.

NICKY

It’s your life, and you’ve lived it as you’ve wanted to live
it--that’s fair----

FLORENCE

Yes--yes.

NICKY

You’ve wanted love always--passionate love, because you were made
like that. It’s not your fault--it’s the fault of circumstances and
civilization; civilization makes rottenness so much easier. We’re
utterly rotten--both of us----

FLORENCE

Nicky--don’t--don’t----

NICKY

How can we help ourselves? We swirl about in a vortex of
beastliness. This is a chance--don’t you see--to realize the
truth--our only chance.

FLORENCE

Oh, Nicky, do stop--go away!

NICKY

Don’t keep on telling me to stop when our only hope is to hammer it
out.

FLORENCE

You’re overwrought. It isn’t as bad as you think.

NICKY

Isn’t it?

FLORENCE

No, no. Of course it isn’t. To-morrow morning you’ll see things
quite differently.

NICKY

You haven’t understood.

FLORENCE

Yes, I have--I have.

NICKY

You haven’t understood. Oh, my God, you haven’t understood! You’re
building up silly defenses in your mind. I’m overwrought. To-morrow
morning I shall see things quite differently. That’s true--that’s
the tragedy of it, and you won’t see. To-morrow morning I _shall_
see things quite differently. All this will seem unreal--a
nightmare--the machinery of our lives will go on again and gloss
over the truth as it always does--and our chance will be gone
forever.

FLORENCE

Chance--chance? What are you talking about--what chance?

NICKY

I must make you see, somehow.

FLORENCE

You’re driving me mad.

NICKY

Have patience with me--please--please----

FLORENCE

[_Wildly_]

How can I have patience with you? You exaggerate everything.

NICKY

No I don’t--I wish I did.

FLORENCE

Listen--let me explain something to you.

NICKY

Very well--go on.

FLORENCE

You’re setting yourself up in judgment on me--your own mother.

NICKY

No, I’m not.

FLORENCE

You are--you are. Let me speak. You don’t understand my temperament
in the least--nobody does--I----

NICKY

You’re deceiving yourself--your temperament’s no different from
thousands of other women, but you’ve been weak and selfish and
given way all along the line----

FLORENCE

Let me speak, I tell you!----

NICKY

What’s the use? You’re still pretending--you’re building up
barriers between us instead of helping me to break them down.

FLORENCE

What are you accusing me of having done?

NICKY

Can’t you see yet?

FLORENCE

No, I can’t. If you’re preaching morality, you’ve no right to.
That’s my affair--I’ve never done any harm to anyone.

NICKY

Look at me.

FLORENCE

Why--what do you mean?

NICKY

You’ve given me _nothing_ all my life--nothing that counts.

FLORENCE

Now you’re pitying yourself.

NICKY

Yes, with every reason.

FLORENCE

You’re neurotic and ridiculous. Just because Bunty broke off your
engagement you come and say wicked, cruel things to me----

NICKY

You forget what I’ve seen to-night, mother.

FLORENCE

I don’t care what you’ve seen.

NICKY

I’ve seen you make a vulgar, disgusting scene in your own house, and
on top of that humiliate yourself before a boy half your age. The
misery of losing Bunty faded away when that happened--everything is
comparative, after all.

FLORENCE

I didn’t humiliate myself----

NICKY

You ran after him up the stairs because your vanity wouldn’t let
you lose him. It isn’t that you love him--that would be easier--you
never love anyone, you only love them loving you--all your
so-called passion and temperament is false--your whole existence
had degenerated into an endless empty craving for admiration
and flattery--and then you say you’ve done no harm to anybody.
Father used to be a clever man, with a strong will and a capacity
for enjoying everything--I can remember him like that--and now
he’s nothing--a complete nonentity because his spirit’s crushed.
How could it be otherwise? You’ve let him down consistently for
years--and God knows I’m nothing for him to look forward to--but I
might have been if it hadn’t been for you----

FLORENCE

Don’t talk like that. Don’t--don’t. It can’t be such a crime being
loved--it can’t be such a crime being happy----

NICKY

You’re not happy--you’re never happy--you’re fighting--fighting all
the time to keep your youth and your looks--because you can’t bear
the thought of living without them--as though they mattered in the
end.

FLORENCE

[_Hysterically_]

What does anything matter--ever?

NICKY

That’s what I’m trying to find out.

FLORENCE

I’m still young inside--I’m still beautiful. Why shouldn’t I live my
life as I choose?

NICKY

You’re not young or beautiful; I’m seeing for the first time how
old you are. It’s horrible--your silly fair hair--and your face all
plastered and painted----

FLORENCE

Nicky--Nicky--stop--stop--stop!

    [_She flings herself face downwards on the bed._ NICKY _goes
    over to her_.]

NICKY

Mother!

FLORENCE

Go away--go away--I hate you--go away----

NICKY

Mother--sit up----

FLORENCE

[_Pulling herself together_]

Go out of my room----

NICKY

Mother----

FLORENCE

I don’t ever want to see you again--you’re insane--you’ve said
wicked, wicked things to me--you’ve talked to me as though I were a
woman off the streets. I can’t bear any more--I can’t bear any more!

NICKY

I have a slight confession to make----

FLORENCE

Confession?

NICKY

Yes.

FLORENCE

Go away--go away----

NICKY

[_Taking a small gold box from his pocket_]

Look----

FLORENCE

What do you mean--what is it----?

NICKY

Don’t you know?

    [FLORENCE _takes the box with trembling fingers and opens it.
    She stares at it for a moment. When she speaks again her voice
    is quite dead._]

FLORENCE

Nicky, it isn’t--you haven’t----?

NICKY

Why do you look so shocked?

FLORENCE

[_Dully_]

Oh, my God!

NICKY

What does it matter?

    [FLORENCE _suddenly rises and hurls the box out of the window_.]

That doesn’t make it any better.

FLORENCE

[_Flinging herself on her knees beside him_]

Nicky, promise me, oh, promise you’ll never do it again--never in
your life--it’s frightful--horrible----

NICKY

It’s only just the beginning.

FLORENCE

What can I say to you--what can I say to you?

NICKY

Nothing--under the circumstances.

FLORENCE

What do you mean?

NICKY

It can’t possibly matter--now.

FLORENCE

Matter--but it’s the finish of everything--you’re young, you’re
just starting on your life--you must stop--you must swear never
to touch it again--swear to me on your oath, Nicky--I’ll help
you--I’ll help you----

NICKY

You!

    [_He turns away._]

FLORENCE

[_Burying her face in her hands and moaning_]

Oh--oh--oh!

NICKY

How could you possibly help me?

FLORENCE

[_Clutching him_]

Nicky!

NICKY

[_Almost losing control_]

Shut up--shut up--don’t touch me----

FLORENCE

[_Trying to take him in her arms_]

Nicky--Nicky----

NICKY

I’m trying to control myself, but you won’t let me--you’re an
awfully rotten woman, really.

FLORENCE

Nicky--stop--stop--stop----

    [_She beats him with her fists._]

NICKY

Leave go of me!

    [_He breaks away from her, and going up to the dressing-table
    he sweeps everything off on to the floor with his arm._]

FLORENCE

[_Screaming_]

Oh--oh--Nicky----!

NICKY

Now then! Now then! You’re not to have any more lovers; you’re not
going to be beautiful and successful ever again--you’re going to be
my mother for once--it’s about time I had one to help me, before I
go over the edge altogether----

FLORENCE

Nicky--Nicky----

NICKY

Promise me to be different--you’ve got to promise me!

FLORENCE

[_Sinking on to the end of couch, facing audience_]

Yes--yes--I promise---- [_The tears are running down her face._]

NICKY

I love you, really--that’s why it’s so awful.

    [_He falls on his knees by her side and buries his face in her
    lap._]

FLORENCE

No. No, not awful--don’t say that--I love you, too.

NICKY

[_Sobbing hopelessly_]

Oh, mother----!

FLORENCE

[_Staring in front of her_]

I wish I were dead!

NICKY

It doesn’t matter about death, but it matters terribly about life.

FLORENCE

I know----

Nicky

[_Desperately_]

Promise me you’ll be different--promise me you’ll be different----

FLORENCE

Yes, yes--I’ll try----

NICKY

We’ll both try.

FLORENCE

Yes, dear.--Oh, my dear----!

    [_She sits quite still, staring in front of her--the tears are
    rolling down her cheeks, and she is stroking_ NICKY’S _hair
    mechanically in an effort to calm him_.]

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the
United States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
